Characteristically, patients present with central visual loss that peaks within\\r\\n      a few days and is often associated with eye pain. Visual loss may be complete. Spontaneous\\r\\n      recovery usually begins within 4 weeks, and marked recovery occurs within 1 to 3 months in\\r\\n      most patients. Although clinical improvement is the rule, not all patients recover fully, and\\r\\n      many are left with residual symptoms. Although there are limited pathological studies in\\r\\n      inflammatory ON, the pathological changes are thought to be virtually identical with those\\r\\n      seen in MS, with disruption of the blood-nerve (brain) barrier; primary demyelination with\\r\\n      axonal sparing; variable degrees of lymphocytic infiltration; an abundance of macrophages\\r\\n      around the inflammatory demyelination lesion; various degrees of remyelination; and, later,\\r\\n      oligodendrocyte loss, axonal loss, and gliosis.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Remyelination by oligodendrocytes occurs early in the MS lesion, as documented by myelin\\r\\n      sheaths that are abnormally thin relative to axon diameter. These thin myelin sheaths are\\r\\n      often seen prominently at the edge of demyelinated plaques. A recent series of studies has\\r\\n      shown that within weeks of the initial event, there is extensive oligodendrocyte regeneration\\r\\n      and remyelination. These immature oligodendrocytes express a series of developmentally\\r\\n      restricted antigens. This finding has been interpreted to suggest that the cells that\\r\\n      repopulate the acute plaque and that affect remyelination are newly generated and not\\r\\n      residual, mature oligodendrocytes. These observations support the possibility that factors\\r\\n      that promote remyelination could be used to improve clinical recovery in ON and MS.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Work at the Mayo Clinic, has shown that both immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed against spinal\\r\\n      cord antigens and purified polyclonal mouse IgG administered systemically promote extensive\\r\\n      remyelination in SJL mice chronically infected with Theiler's virus. In addition, tissue\\r\\n      culture studies suggest that IgG directed against CNS components may promote oligodendroglial\\r\\n      proliferation and differentiation. Thus, experimental evidence exists for the concept that\\r\\n      immunoglobulins may stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocytes. It\\r\\n      is possible that myelin components on the surface of oligodendrocytes could function as\\r\\n      receptors or components of receptors.

Some of these people may also be candidates for radial keratotomy (RK), a\\r\\n      procedure that aims to correct or reduce myopia by surgery that flattens the corneal\\r\\n      curvature.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Keratotomy was first performed by surgeons in Europe and the United States in the late 1800s,\\r\\n      and the basic optical and mechanical principles of the operation were defined in the 1940s\\r\\n      and 1950s by the Japanese doctors T. Sato and K. Akiyama, who used anterior and posterior\\r\\n      corneal incisions. The posterior incisions damaged the cornea, and the procedure was modified\\r\\n      in the Soviet Union by doctors Fyodorov and V. Durnev to include incisions in only the\\r\\n      anterior cornea. Since its introduction into the United States in 1978, numerous\\r\\n      ophthalmologists have modified the procedure by introducing technical and surgical\\r\\n      improvements such as ultrasonic methods to measure the thickness of the cornea and the use of\\r\\n      diamond-bladed micrometer knives to make the incisions.\\r\\n\\r\\n      However, scientific assessment of RK lagged behind growing public and professional interest\\r\\n      in the procedure. In 1980, in response to widespread concern about the long-term safety and\\r\\n      efficacy of RK, a group of ophthalmic surgeons approached the National Eye Institute with a\\r\\n      proposal for a multicenter clinical trial that would evaluate the potential benefits and\\r\\n      risks of this procedure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Prospective Evaluation of Radial Keratotomy study, involving 435 patients and 99 pilot\\r\\n      patients, was a clinical trial designed to evaluate the short- and long-term safety and\\r\\n      efficacy of one technique of radial keratotomy. The procedure was evaluated by comparing a\\r\\n      patient's refractive error and uncorrected vision before and after surgery. The more myopic\\r\\n      eye received surgery first. Patients were required to wait 1 year before having the operation\\r\\n      on the second eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The surgical technique was standardized, consisting of eight centrifugal radial incisions\\r\\n      made manually with a diamond micrometer knife. The diameter of the central, uncut, clear zone\\r\\n      was determined by the preoperative spherical equivalent cycloplegic refraction (-2.00 to\\r\\n      -3.12 D = 4.0 mm; -3.25 to -4.3 D = 3.5 mm; -4.50 to -8.00 D = 3.0 mm). The blade length,\\r\\n      which determined the depth of the incision, was set at 100 percent of the thinnest of four\\r\\n      intraoperative ultrasonic corneal thickness readings taken paracentrally at the 3-, 6-, 9-,\\r\\n      and 12-o'clock meridians just outside the mark delineating the clear zone. The incisions were\\r\\n      made from the edge of the trephine mark to the limbal vascular arcade and were spaced\\r\\n      equidistantly around the cornea.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Patients were examined preoperatively and after surgery at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months,\\r\\n      annually for 5 years, and at 10 years. Examinations in the morning and evening of the same\\r\\n      day were done at 3 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 11 years in a subset of the patients to test\\r\\n      for diurnal fluctuation of vision and refraction.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The primary outcome variables measured at each visit was the uncorrected and\\r\\n      spectacle-corrected visual acuity and the refractive error with the pupil dilated and\\r\\n      undilated.

The most common form of\\r\\n      myopia is childhood myopia, which begins after age 6 and progresses rapidly until age 16.\\r\\n      Myopia progression results from excessive growth of the eye, primarily by enlargement of the\\r\\n      vitreous chamber. Excessive elongation of the eye is a major risk factor for retinal\\r\\n      detachment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Previous prospective studies failed to show that use of bifocals was effective in slowing\\r\\n      myopia progression. However, these studies did not separate subjects by near-point phoria\\r\\n      before randomization. Retrospective studies by David Goss indicated that bifocals slowed\\r\\n      myopia progression by almost 50 percent in children with near-point esophoria but had no\\r\\n      effect on children with exophoria.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A small, prospective pilot study, completed by the investigators of this trial, also\\r\\n      supported the hypothesis that bifocals slow myopia progression in children with near-point\\r\\n      esophoria. Thirty-two myopic children, all of whom showed near-point esophoria, were enrolled\\r\\n      in this 18-month study. Twenty-eight children completed the study, with 14 randomized into\\r\\n      bifocals and 14 into single-vision lenses. Cycloplegic automated refraction was performed\\r\\n      every 6 months. Over the course of the whole study, there was a small, statistically\\r\\n      insignificant difference in the rates of myopia progression: 0.57 diopters per year (D/yr)\\r\\n      (S.E. = 0.11) for those in single-vision lenses compared with 0.36 D/yr (S.E. = 0.12) for\\r\\n      those in bifocals (p = 0.26).\\r\\n\\r\\n      However, significant seasonal effects in myopia progression were demonstrated, and the\\r\\n      results also suggested that the beneficial effects of bifocals may take several months to\\r\\n      develop. During the first 6 months, which included most of the school year, myopia\\r\\n      progression was rapid in both the bifocal group (0.61 D/yr) and the single-vision group (0.68\\r\\n      D/yr). During the second 6 months, which included all of the summer vacation, myopia\\r\\n      progression was slow in both groups, 0.32 and 0.26 D/yr for bifocal wearers and single-vision\\r\\n      wearers, respectively. During the last 6 months, i.e., the second school year, myopia\\r\\n      progressed slowly in the bifocal wearers (0.37 D/yr) but rapidly (0.80 D/yr) in single-vision\\r\\n      wearers. A repeated-measure analysis of variance demonstrated a significant seasonal effect\\r\\n      (p < 0.002) and a significant interaction between season and type of correction (p < 0.043).\\r\\n\\r\\n      The apparent effectiveness of bifocals in children with near-point esophoria and the lack of\\r\\n      effectiveness in other children may be explained by a greater lag of accommodation in\\r\\n      children with esophoria. This lag might cause a slightly blurred retinal image that the\\r\\n      bifocal may sharpen. Other mechanisms might also be involved.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Eighty or more myopic children, all with near-point esophoria as measured at baseline with\\r\\n      von Graefe prisms through a current myopic correction placed in a phoropter, will be randomly\\r\\n      assigned to wear either single-vision spectacle lenses or lenses with +1.50 D add in a\\r\\n      flat-top 28-mm segment.

Uveitis may lead to many sight-threatening conditions,\\r\\n      including cataract, vitreal opacities, glaucoma, and, most commonly, cystoid macular edema.\\r\\n      Reduction of swelling or edema within the retina depends on the movement of fluid from the\\r\\n      retina through the choroid. A number of studies indicate that this process requires active\\r\\n      transport of fluid ions by the retinal pigment epithelium and may involve the carbonic\\r\\n      anhydrase system. Current treatment of uveitis-associated cystoid macular edema requires the\\r\\n      use of immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory agents. However, many patients are either\\r\\n      resistant or intolerant to this therapy. Recent reports suggested that acetazolamide, a\\r\\n      carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is used to lower intraocular pressure in some glaucoma\\r\\n      patients, might be safe and effective in reducing uveitis-associated cystoid macular edema.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Because the course of ocular inflammatory disease can be variable, a double-masked,\\r\\n      randomized, crossover trial was designed to test the efficacy of acetazolamide compared with\\r\\n      a placebo for the treatment of uveitis-associated cystoid macular edema. Randomized adult\\r\\n      patients received either oral acetazolamide sodium 500 mg or a matched placebo every 12 hours\\r\\n      for the first 4 weeks of the study. Children 8 years of age or older received a lesser dose\\r\\n      based on body weight. Following a 4-week period, during which no medication was given,\\r\\n      patients then received a 4-week course of the opposite medication.

Before the COMS was initiated in 1986, interest in radiation therapy had\\r\\n      increased because of the potential for saving the eye and perhaps some vision. However, the\\r\\n      merits of radiation with respect to prolonging patient survival were unknown. The best data\\r\\n      from nonrandomized studies suggested that there was no difference in length of remaining life\\r\\n      between patients treated with radiation and those whose eyes were enucleated. Thus, it was\\r\\n      appropriate and necessary to conduct a randomized, controlled clinical trial in which a large\\r\\n      number of patients would be followed for many years in order to compare enucleation and\\r\\n      radiation with respect to relative success in prolonging survival of choroidal melanoma\\r\\n      patients.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) is a set of long-term, multicenter, randomized\\r\\n      controlled trials. In the trial for patients with tumors of medium size, enucleation and\\r\\n      irradiation with an iodine-125 episcleral plaque are compared on the basis of length of\\r\\n      remaining life. All randomized patients will be followed for 5 to 15 years or until death.\\r\\n      For patients randomly assigned to enucleation, the eye was removed following a standard\\r\\n      procedure. For patients assigned to plaque irradiation, the margins of the tumor were located\\r\\n      and the dimensions of the tumor were measured by the ophthalmic surgeon. A gold plaque with a\\r\\n      plastic seed carrier that contained the proper dosage and configuration of radioactive iodine\\r\\n      seeds was sutured to the outside (sclera) of the eye over the base of the tumor. This\\r\\n      procedure made possible the delivery of a high dose of radiation to a very localized area (85\\r\\n      Gy [TG-43] to the tumor apex). The plaque typically was removed from the eye after three to\\r\\n      seven days.

No proven treatment currently exists to reverse or arrest this loss.\\r\\n      There is no accepted method for the prevention or reduction of the likelihood of second eye\\r\\n      involvement. NAION strikes both eyes in as many as 40 percent of affected patients (Beri et\\r\\n      al. 1987), with a 2-year risk of about 25 percent (Steven Feldon, personal communication to\\r\\n      SEK).\\r\\n\\r\\n      IONDT compared optic nerve decompression surgery (ONDS), which was becoming a widely used\\r\\n      treatment for NAION, with careful followup alone, in patients with newly diagnosed NAION. The\\r\\n      rationale for the surgery was that NAION was caused by impaired blood flow to the optic nerve\\r\\n      and that decompression surgery would restore vision by alleviating pressure surrounding the\\r\\n      nerve. Because ONDS was fast becoming the standard of care, evaluation of the safety and\\r\\n      efficacy of the procedure was tested in the context of a randomized clinical trial.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Within 2 years of the start of the IONDT, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee\\r\\n      recommended cessation of the clinical trial recruitment. The National Institutes of Health\\r\\n      issued a clinical alert to 25,000 ophthalmologists and neurologists describing the study\\r\\n      findings that surgery was no better than careful followup and may be harmful (IONDT 1995). It\\r\\n      was recommended that ONDS not be used in cases of NAION. Thus, the IONDT findings not only\\r\\n      have led to a costly and ineffective surgery to be abandoned as a treatment for NAION, but\\r\\n      also have left practitioners with a dearth of treatment choices.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The IONDT is the first multicenter, prospective study of newly diagnosed patients with NAION.\\r\\n      The baseline history and examination, which took place within 14 days of the onset of\\r\\n      symptoms, used standardized methods and diagnostic criteria to collect data on all factors\\r\\n      possibly relating to the etiology of NAION. In reports from previous studies that present\\r\\n      data on both initial and final visual acuities, no data are available regarding change in\\r\\n      visual acuity over time for individual patients. Where data are available on final visual\\r\\n      acuity, reported rates of improvement are low, ranging from 0 percent to 33 percent for\\r\\n      untreated eyes. The IONDT found, however, an improvement of three or more lines in 42.7\\r\\n      percent of patients who received careful followup.\\r\\n\\r\\n      NAION in both eyes has been reported in as few as 10.5 percent and as many as 73 percent of\\r\\n      patients. In a study of bilateral NAION where all patients were prospectively logged, Beri et\\r\\n      al. reported that 17.5 percent of patients developed bilateral disease at 1 year of followup\\r\\n      and 34.5 percent developed it at 5 years. However, Beck et al., using a life table analysis\\r\\n      on the same cohort reported by Beri et al., estimated the risk of bilateral NAION to be 12\\r\\n      percent within 2 years and 19 percent within 5 years. The IONDT has so far similarly reported\\r\\n      a 12 percent (25/216) incidence of bilateral NAION in its randomized patients. The incidence\\r\\n      in the nonrandomized group, 91 percent of whom had visual acuity better than 20/64, is much\\r\\n      lower at 4 percent (5/136).\\r\\n\\r\\n      Thus, continued followup of the IONDT cohort is critically important to ascertain a clear\\r\\n      picture of the natural history of NAION in terms of involvement of the second eye and\\r\\n      long-term vision. Data obtained will be critical in understanding the etiology of the disease\\r\\n      and in generating hypotheses for testing further treatments for the disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The IONDT Followup Study will continue to monitor vision and other health outcomes in\\r\\n      patients originally enrolled in the IONDT, whether randomized to one of the two treatment\\r\\n      groups or whether followed as part of the natural history cohort. All IONDT patients were\\r\\n      diagnosed with NAION within 14 days of onset of symptoms, have had a minimum of 2 years of\\r\\n      continuous followup, and will be followed for an additional 4 years in the Followup Study.\\r\\n      Patients will have annual visits at the original IONDT Clinical Center or, if necessary, with\\r\\n      a surrogate provider.

It is estimated that 2 million people in the United States have\\r\\n      glaucoma and that 80,000 of these individuals are legally blind from the disease. Among\\r\\n      African Americans, glaucoma is now recognized as the leading cause of blindness.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), a common condition affecting 3 to 6 million people in\\r\\n      the United States, is thought to be the leading risk factor for development of open-angle\\r\\n      glaucoma. There is no consensus that medical reduction of intraocular pressure prevents or\\r\\n      delays the onset of visual field and/or optic nerve damage in ocular hypertensive subjects.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Despite the lack of convincing evidence for the efficacy of medical treatment in ocular\\r\\n      hypertension, approximately 1.5 million glaucoma suspects in the United States are being\\r\\n      treated with costly ocular hypotensive medications that carry the potential for serious and\\r\\n      even life-threatening side effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Clearly, there is a need for a well-controlled clinical trial to determine whether medical\\r\\n      reduction of IOP can prevent or delay the onset of glaucomatous damage in ocular hypertensive\\r\\n      subjects. Only then can clinicians and patients make rational choices and health care\\r\\n      planners ensure that limited medical resources are being allocated in a safe and\\r\\n      cost-effective manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) is a long-term, randomized, controlled\\r\\n      multicenter clinical trial. Ocular hypertensive subjects judged to be at moderate risk of\\r\\n      developing primary open-angle glaucoma are randomly assigned to either close observation only\\r\\n      or a stepped medical regimen. Medical treatment consists of all commercially available\\r\\n      topical ocular hypotensive eye drops.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After completion of baseline measures (IOP, visual fields, disc photos) and randomization,\\r\\n      the subjects are followed for a minimum of 5 years with automated threshold central static\\r\\n      perimetry (Humphrey program 30-2) twice yearly and stereoscopic optic disc photographs once\\r\\n      yearly. Study end points are reproducible visual field loss and/or progressive optic disc\\r\\n      damage in either eye of a patient attributed to glaucoma by a Masked Endpoint Committee. All\\r\\n      visual fields and optic disc photographs are read in a masked fashion in Reading Centers.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the 1991 Baltimore Eye Survey, African Americans were shown to have a prevalence of\\r\\n      open-angle glaucoma four to five times higher than whites. Given this high prevalence of\\r\\n      glaucoma in the African American population, it is important to recruit and follow an\\r\\n      adequate sample of African American subjects in the trial (approximately 25 percent of the\\r\\n      total patient sample).\\r\\n\\r\\n      At the conclusion of this study, practitioners should be able to make reasonable estimates of\\r\\n      risk for individual ocular hypertensive patients and to determine which ocular hypertensive\\r\\n      individuals are most likely to benefit from early prophylactic medical treatment.\\r\\n    BuprenorphineN/AN/AMale\",\n",

Visual function can be\\r\\n      impaired through decreased central visual acuity or peripheral field loss, or both. NAION\\r\\n      strikes both eyes in up to 40 percent of affected patients. The incidence of NAION has been\\r\\n      estimated at 2.3 per 100,000 persons over the age of 50 years and 0.54 per 100,000 for all\\r\\n      ages. Estimates of the number of new cases seen each year in the United States range from a\\r\\n      low of approximately 1,500 to a high of 6,000.\\r\\n\\r\\n      NAION has been hypothesized to be caused by vascular insufficiency leading to optic nerve\\r\\n      head ischemia. There is general agreement that NAION results from transient non-perfusion of\\r\\n      nutrient vessels. The wide range of visual field defects and visual loss with NAION can be\\r\\n      explained by the extent and number of the blood vessels involved.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Anatomical factors appear to contribute to the vascular event initiating NAION. Clinically,\\r\\n      the number of discs congenitally lacking a physiological cup in eyes with NAION is higher\\r\\n      than expected. Presumably, in eyes with NAION, these discs have small scleral openings that\\r\\n      crowd the nerve fibers as they pass through the restricted space in the optic disc and lamina\\r\\n      cribrosa, thereby predisposing to an ischemic spiral.\\r\\n\\r\\n      One current theory holds that NAION begins as a minor ischemic event that later progresses to\\r\\n      a major infarction due to congenitally anomalous optic nerves. The inciting ischemic event\\r\\n      leads to local anterior nerve edema, and this causes further ischemia.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Optic nerve sheath decompression surgery was reported in 1989 to be of benefit to patients\\r\\n      with NAION. The presumed mechanism of action in optic nerve decompression surgery revolved\\r\\n      around restoration of impaired blood flow to the optic nerve through reduction of the\\r\\n      pressure around the nerve.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial (IONDT) was a randomized clinical trial\\r\\n      designed to compare the improvements in visual acuity at 6 months in patients assigned to\\r\\n      receive surgery with optic nerve sheath decompression with those assigned to careful\\r\\n      followup.

It is highly prevalent in our society and even more frequent in\\r\\n      Asian countries; furthermore, its prevalence may be increasing over time. High myopia\\r\\n      contributes to significant loss of vision and blindness. At present, the mechanisms involved\\r\\n      in the etiology of myopia are unclear, and there is no way to prevent the condition. Current\\r\\n      methods of correction require lifelong use of lenses or surgical treatment, which is\\r\\n      expensive and may lead to complications. The rationale for this trial, the Correction of\\r\\n      Myopia Evaluation Trial (COMET), arises from the convergence of research involving (1) the\\r\\n      link between accommodation and myopia in children and (2) animal models of myopia showing the\\r\\n      important role of the visual environment in eye growth.

The primary aim of COMET, to\\r\\n      evaluate the efficacy of progressive addition lenses, a noninvasive intervention, in slowing\\r\\n      the progression of myopia, follows from this line of reasoning. These lenses should provide\\r\\n      clear visual input over a range of viewing distances without focusing effort by the child.\\r\\n      The comparison of myopia progression in children treated with PALs versus single vision\\r\\n      lenses will allow the quantification of the effect of PALs on myopia progression during the\\r\\n      followup period.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The COMET is a multicenter, randomized, double-masked clinical trial to evaluate whether PALs\\r\\n      slow the progression of juvenile-onset myopia as compared with single vision lenses.

Despite its common\\r\\n      occurrence, limited information is available about its early clinical course. Such data are\\r\\n      needed to determine the earliest age at which surgery can be safely performed without concern\\r\\n      that the esotropia is likely to resolve spontaneously. Although the term congenital esotropia\\r\\n      implies that the esotropia is present at birth, in many cases the esotropia actually develops\\r\\n      sometime during the first few months of life. It is well recognized that congenital esotropia\\r\\n      persisting through 6 months of age rarely if ever resolves spontaneously and therefore\\r\\n      requires surgical correction. However, it is not clear how often congenital esotropia occurs\\r\\n      and then resolves (at an earlier age such that surgery is not necessary) before surgery is\\r\\n      required.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Current clinical practice is to defer surgery for congenital esotropia until 6 to 12 months\\r\\n      of age. Assuming that characteristics of congenital esotropia at 2 to 4 months of age can be\\r\\n      identified to predict which cases will require surgery, then a trial will be warranted to\\r\\n      determine whether performing earlier surgery enhances the development of binocular vision.\\r\\n      The potential benefit to very early surgery is supported by neurophysiologic research, which\\r\\n      has shown that (1) congenital esotropes may be born with the innate ability to develop\\r\\n      binocular vision, (2) there is a critical period for development of normal binocular function\\r\\n      within the first few months of life that is dependent on alignment of the visual axes of the\\r\\n      two eyes, and (3) ocular misalignment alone, regardless of its mechanism, without a\\r\\n      coexisting primary cortical fusion deficit, can account for abnormal development of binocular\\r\\n      vision. Clinical reports have demonstrated that surgical correction of the esotropia between\\r\\n      6 and 12 months of age provides for enhanced development of stereoacuity compared with later\\r\\n      surgery. However, there are limited data on the outcomes in infants who had surgical\\r\\n      correction before age 6 months.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The protocol for the study is identical to usual clinical practice.

The main theoretical advantage for the krypton laser\\r\\n      in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy is that the red laser beam penetrates blood and may\\r\\n      be more effective in making burns in the pigment epithelium in eyes with vitreous hemorrhage.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The burns produced by the krypton laser in the retina are different from those produced by\\r\\n      the argon laser. Specifically, the burns from the krypton laser do not involve the inner\\r\\n      retina. Also, the krypton laser spares the nerve fiber layer near the macula. In contrast,\\r\\n      nerve fiber layer burns are common with the argon laser. Pigment epithelium and outer\\r\\n      segments are usually destroyed by both krypton and argon photocoagulation, but there is no\\r\\n      uptake of energy by the vascular tissues within the retina when krypton photocoagulation is\\r\\n      used. Further, krypton treatment is more effective in penetrating nuclear sclerosis of the\\r\\n      lens and can be used to treat some diabetic eyes with this condition that cannot be treated\\r\\n      with the argon laser.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the KARNS, patients with diabetic retinopathy and NVD of one-third disc area or greater in\\r\\n      extent were assigned at random to either argon or krypton laser scatter photocoagulation\\r\\n      (panretinal photocoagulation). The null hypothesis was that each treatment would result in a\\r\\n      similar proportion of eyes having regression of the NVD by 3 months. The KARNS pilot study\\r\\n      affirmed the benefits of argon laser photocoagulation in the treatment of proliferative\\r\\n      diabetic retinopathy, as demonstrated in the NEI-supported Diabetic Retinopathy Study\\r\\n      conducted a decade ago. (See publication list.) The KARNS study sought to determine whether\\r\\n      use of the krypton laser could be as effective as the argon laser in causing regression of\\r\\n      diabetic neovascularization, but with fewer side effects (such as smaller loss of central\\r\\n      visual acuity).\\r\\n\\r\\n      Thirty-two nationwide clinical centers participated initially in this multicenter clinical\\r\\n      trial. Following the initial study examination, the baseline examination and fundus\\r\\n      photographs were obtained within 1 week before application of photocoagulation. Study\\r\\n      followup visits occurred at 3 months and 1 year after entry in the study. Additional visits\\r\\n      were scheduled as clinically necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The specific techniques for photocoagulation were similar for both argon and krypton scatter\\r\\n      photocoagulation. Scatter (panretinal) photocoagulation consisted of 1,600 to 2,000 burns\\r\\n      placed 0.5 to 1 burn width apart. Burns of moderate intensity (whiteness) and 500 ??m in size\\r\\n      at the retina were required. The burns were applied to the retinal periphery no closer than 2\\r\\n      disc diameters from the center of the fovea and 500 ??m from the margin of the optic disc.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In December 1985, the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study groups reported that focal\\r\\n      photocoagulation was effective in reducing the rates of moderate visual loss in patients with\\r\\n      clinically significant diabetic macular edema. The KARNS protocol was then changed to allow\\r\\n      focal treatment for clinically significant macular edema in all study participants and to\\r\\n      allow an eye that had previous focal photocoagulation for macular edema to become eligible\\r\\n      for study.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The study primary end point was regression of NVD, as assessed on the 3-month visit stereo\\r\\n      fundus photographs of the disc, to less than one-third disc area in extent.

In the era of prophylaxis for pneumocystic pneumonia, CMV disease is\\r\\n      estimated to affect 45 percent of patients with AIDS sometime between the diagnosis of AIDS\\r\\n      and death. Retinitis has been estimated to account for up to 85 percent of CMV disease in\\r\\n      these patients, making CMV retinitis the most common ocular infection encountered. CMV\\r\\n      retinitis is a relatively late-stage manifestation, associated with cluster of\\r\\n      differentiation 4 (CD4) + T-cell counts < 100 cells/µL and often < 50 cells/µL.\\r\\n\\r\\n      All currently available treatments for CMV suppress viral replication but do not eliminate\\r\\n      the virus from the body. Discontinuation of therapy is associated with a prompt relapse of\\r\\n      the retinitis. Despite the use of chronic suppressive therapy, relapse of the retinitis\\r\\n      generally occurs, at least with systemically administered anti-CMV drugs.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The first two treatments approved for CMV retinitis were intravenous ganciclovir and\\r\\n      intravenous foscarnet. Both are given by daily intravenous infusions and therefore require\\r\\n      central venous catheters. The development of newer treatments has focused not only on\\r\\n      efficacious treatments, but also on treatments that do not require central venous catheters.\\r\\n      Available treatments now include oral ganciclovir, the ganciclovir intraocular device, and\\r\\n      intravenous cidofovir.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In vitro data suggest that combination therapies are synergistic in inhibiting viral\\r\\n      replication; these therapies include a foscarnet-ganciclovir combination and a\\r\\n      cidofovir-ganciclovir combination. In the SOCA--CMV Retinitis Retreatment Trial, the\\r\\n      combination of intravenous ganciclovir and foscarnet was more effective than either drug\\r\\n      alone for the treatment of relapsed retinitis. Therefore, the combination of intermittent\\r\\n      intravenous cidofovir and daily oral ganciclovir may be an attractive therapy for relapsed\\r\\n      disease because it may provide synergy for controlling both ocular and visceral disease while\\r\\n      not necessitating either a central venous catheter or an intraocular surgical procedure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Ganciclovir-Cidofovir CMV Retinitis Trial (GCCRT) is a randomized, multicenter clinical\\r\\n      trial. Patients will be assigned to receive one of two regimens: (1) ganciclovir intraocular\\r\\n      device plus oral ganciclovir or (2) intravenous cidofovir. The intraocular device will be\\r\\n      surgically implanted at baseline and again every 6 to 8 months in eyes with CMV retinitis.\\r\\n      Oral ganciclovir is taken at a dose of 1 gram three times daily. Cidofovir will be\\r\\n      administered intravenously at 5 mg/kg once weekly for 2 consecutive weeks and once every 2\\r\\n      weeks thereafter. If disease progression occurs in patients receiving cidofovir, patients\\r\\n      will be given reinduction therapy, and oral ganciclovir at a dose of 1 gram three times per\\r\\n      day will be added to the treatment. If patients assigned to cidofovir are unable to tolerate\\r\\n      that regimen, an alternative systemic regimen will be recommended.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Study outcome variables include a decrease of three or more lines from baseline in best\\r\\n      corrected visual acuity and rate of visual field loss.

Current estimates indicate that about 27,000 infants of\\r\\n      extremely low birth weight are born annually, of which 74 percent will survive. As techniques\\r\\n      of managing smaller and less mature preterm infants continue to improve, it is expected that\\r\\n      the number of infants at risk for blindness will continue to increase.\\r\\n\\r\\n      For infants weighing less than 1,251 grams at birth, the Cryotherapy for Retinopathy of\\r\\n      Prematurity (CRYO-ROP) Study has shown that the risk of developing severe, acute (threshold)\\r\\n      ROP is 6 percent. Although cryotherapy, when applied at the time of threshold ROP, reduces\\r\\n      the rate of unfavorable visual outcome, 35 percent of eyes that develop this level of severe,\\r\\n      acute disease are blind 1 year after treatment. Moreover, cryotherapy is destructive. Even\\r\\n      when cryotherapy prevents progression to retinal detachment, it is associated with peripheral\\r\\n      retinal destruction and may, in some cases, be associated with subnormal central vision due\\r\\n      to high myopia and/or macular scarring. Corrective surgical treatments for retinal detachment\\r\\n      caused by ROP have proven to be of little visual benefit. A preventive treatment for ROP that\\r\\n      is safe, efficacious, easily applied, and inexpensive is desirable.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The investigators hypothesize that reducing the amount of light that reaches the eyes of\\r\\n      preterm infants may be effective in preventing ROP. Although previous reports on the use of\\r\\n      light reduction to the eyes of preterm infants in the nursery have produced conflicting\\r\\n      results, there are sufficient reasons to believe that this strategy may be effective in\\r\\n      reducing the incidence and severity of ROP. These reasons center on the role of light in the\\r\\n      production of destructive free radicals. Supplemental oxygen produces the same free radicals,\\r\\n      and the two mechanisms may be additive.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In this masked, controlled study, infants weighing less than 1,251 grams at birth were\\r\\n      prospectively randomized within 24 hours of birth to wear goggles or not to wear goggles.\\r\\n      Goggles contain 97 percent near neutral density filters and were worn until the infant\\r\\n      reached either 31 weeks gestational age or 4 weeks postnatal age, whichever was longer.

Eyes of all infants were examined on a prescribed schedule by certified\\r\\n      examiners to determine the incidence of any confirmed ROP.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The primary objective of this study is to answer the following question: Does light reduction\\r\\n      to the eyes of extremely low birth-weight infants decrease the incidence of any confirmed ROP\\r\\n      (at least 3 contiguous clock hours, any stage, any zone)? The primary end points are\\r\\n      therefore ROP or full vascularization.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the following question: Does light\\r\\n      reduction to the eyes of extremely low birth-weight infants decrease the incidence of more\\r\\n      severe ROP (prethreshold ROP -- the secondary end point)?\\r\\n\\r\\n      The study has recruited approximately 400 infants, equally divided into goggle-wearing and\\r\\n      control group.

Women were recruited after the 28th week of pregnancy and had to be\\r\\n        English-speaking. In addition, they planned to stay at the hospital at least 48 hours\\r\\n        following delivery and lived in the greater Seattle metropolitan area. Infants were\\r\\n        eligible whether they were delivered vaginally or by cesarean section. Excluded from the\\r\\n        study were siblings of infants enrolled in the study, women who were culture-positive for\\r\\n        gonorrhea, infants receiving systemic antimicrobials for reasons other than conjunctivitis,\\r\\n        women receiving antimicrobials at the time of delivery, and families unlikely to be\\r\\n        available for followup after delivery.\\r\\n      \\n      Cataract is one of the most common causes of impaired vision as well as the third leading\\r\\n      cause of blindness in the United States. Cataract surgery is one of the safest and most\\r\\n      successful of all operations. The National Eye Institute has estimated that if the\\r\\n      progression of cataract could be slowed enough to delay the need for surgery by even 10\\r\\n      years, the current annual number could be reduced by 45 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Little is known about the relative importance of various potential risk factors in the\\r\\n      development of cataract. Most current information on risk factors has come from anecdotal\\r\\n      reports or from relatively small case-control studies. One major project, the Framingham Eye\\r\\n      Study, has identified several factors that were significantly associated with subsequent\\r\\n      cataract formation, including diabetes and dietary factors. Diabetes has long been thought to\\r\\n      increase the risk of developing cataract.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Recently, aspirin has been proposed as a drug that can prevent cataract formation or slow its\\r\\n      progression. Aspirin may affect tryptophan levels in patients with cataract, or it may\\r\\n      inhibit aldose reductase, an enzyme associated with the development of diabetic cataract.\\r\\n      Thus, data from this study sought to determine whether one 325-mg aspirin tablet, taken on\\r\\n      alternate days, protects against cataract formation. The data also sought to reveal other\\r\\n      additional cataract risk factors that emerge after simultaneous controlling for other\\r\\n      variables.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The other primary objective of this trial was to assess the antioxidant effects of\\r\\n      beta-carotene (50 mg on alternate days) on cataract development. In addition, factors that\\r\\n      have been suggested to be cataractogenic were assessed in prospective cohort studies. These\\r\\n      factors included age, blood pressure, blood cholesterol, height, diabetes, medication use,\\r\\n      cigarette smoking, and history of previous eye trauma or surgery. In addition, the possible\\r\\n      associations between history of vitamin E and selenium intake and cataract were explored.\\r\\n\\r\\n      This trial was part of the Physicians Health Study, an ongoing, randomized,\\r\\n      placebo-controlled clinical trial of aspirin in the prevention of cardiovascular mortality\\r\\n      and of beta-carotene in the prevention of cancer. Following randomization, each of the 22,071\\r\\n      physicians enrolled was assigned to one of four groups to take either aspirin or its placebo\\r\\n      and beta-carotene or its placebo. Follow-up questionnaires were sent 6 and 12 months after\\r\\n      randomization and every 12 months thereafter. The randomized aspirin component of the trial\\r\\n      was terminated early (January 1988), after an average followup of approximately 5 years,\\r\\n      because of a statistically extreme 44 percent reduced risk of a first myocardial infarction\\r\\n      in the aspirin group.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Since this study is conducted by mail among physicians nationwide, examinations cannot be\\r\\n      performed on all patients to determine when they have reached an end point. Reported\\r\\n      diagnoses of cataract are confirmed by medical record review. The primary analysis will be of\\r\\n      incidence of cataract in the aspirin and placebo groups. In addition, the Cox proportional\\r\\n      hazards model will be used to determine whether there is a difference in time to cataract\\r\\n      diagnosis between the two groups. It has been postulated that the potent antioxidant\\r\\n      properties of beta-carotene might make it effective in preventing cataract development. The\\r\\n      investigators will thus determine whether there is a difference in the numbers of cataracts\\r\\n      between the beta-carotene/placebo groups and the aspirin/placebo groups.\\r\\n    Xenon1 YearN/AAll',\n",

Based on many clinical studies, it is apparent that the frequency of both diseases\\r\\n      increases dramatically after age 60. Although excellent treatments for cataract are\\r\\n      available, there are no equivalent treatments for AMD. As the average lifespan of our\\r\\n      population increases, the number of people who develop AMD will increase dramatically in the\\r\\n      years ahead.

Possibly associated with\\r\\n      AMD are personal characteristics, such as age, race, height, family history, and strength of\\r\\n      hand grip; ocular characteristics, such as hyperopia and color of iris; and cardiovascular\\r\\n      diseases, smoking, lung infections, and chemical exposures. Clinical and laboratory studies\\r\\n      suggest the following factors may be associated with progression of AMD: drusen type,\\r\\n      choroidal vascular diseases, and photic injury.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Epidemiologic studies of cataract suggest that associated risk factors may include personal\\r\\n      characteristics, such as age, sex, race, occupation, and educational status; ocular\\r\\n      characteristics, such as iris color; and diabetes mellitus, hypertension, drug exposure,\\r\\n      smoking, and sunlight exposure. Animal studies and observational epidemiologic studies\\r\\n      suggest that deficiencies in vitamins C and E, carotenoids, and the trace elements zinc and\\r\\n      selenium also may be associated with the development of the two diseases, especially\\r\\n      cataract.

Subsequently, hospitals cut back on giving excessive oxygen\\r\\n      routinely to premature babies. But, with improvements in neonatal care over the last two\\r\\n      decades, the number of babies at risk is increasing as survival rates for smaller premature\\r\\n      infants improve. The lower the birth weight, the higher the incidence and severity of ROP.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In a more recent NEI-supported study at the University of Miami, blood oxygen levels of very\\r\\n      low birth-weight infants were monitored continuously by use of transcutaneous measurements as\\r\\n      long as oxygen therapy was needed. The study showed that there is no statistically\\r\\n      significant difference between the rates of ROP in infants monitored on continuous oxygen\\r\\n      therapy and in those monitored only when they were receiving oxygen in excess of 40 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Supplemental Therapeutic Oxygen for Prethreshold ROP (STOP-ROP) trial, also funded by the\\r\\n      NEI, studied whether a slight increase in oxygen therapy would prevent the progression of\\r\\n      moderate ROP to ROP severe enough to require surgical treatment. This intervention made\\r\\n      little or no difference in outcomes.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Likewise, another NEI-sponsored clinical trial (LIGHT-ROP) demonstrated absence of protective\\r\\n      effect on ROP by limiting light exposure to newborn premature infants. These studies have led\\r\\n      to the conclusion that factors other than oxygen or light exposure must be involved in\\r\\n      causing ROP.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In most infants who develop ROP, the disease spontaneously subsides, permitting development\\r\\n      of normal vision. But other infants who progress to a severe form of ROP are in danger of\\r\\n      becoming permanently blind. Although the cause of ROP is not fully explained, scientists are\\r\\n      seeking ways to treat ROP successfully and to find the right time in the progression of the\\r\\n      disease to use treatment. Cryotherapy, which destroys the fringe of the retina through\\r\\n      freezing, is the only treatment so far that has been demonstrated to provide substantial\\r\\n      benefit to these eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The multicenter trial of cryotherapy for ROP enrolled more than 4,000 premature infants who\\r\\n      weighed no more than 1,250 grams at birth. This category of infants is at the greatest risk\\r\\n      of developing ROP. The eyes of the infants enrolled in the study were examined at\\r\\n      predetermined intervals while the subjects were still in the intensive care nursery. After\\r\\n      the pupils were dilated with eye drops, the eyes were examined by an ophthalmologist using a\\r\\n      binocular indirect ophthalmoscope to visualize the developing retina. The natural history of\\r\\n      the condition of each infant's retina was recorded. When examination disclosed the severe\\r\\n      form of ROP (threshold ROP) in both eyes, and the parents gave informed consent, one of the\\r\\n      infant's eyes was randomly selected to receive cryotherapy. In this technique, a cryoprobe\\r\\n      was used to freeze and thus destroy the peripheral extent of the retina, thereby arresting\\r\\n      the development of the blood vessels growing wildly toward it.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Outcome of the therapy was assessed at 3 months and 12 months following randomization by an\\r\\n      extensive examination that included photography of the interior of both the treated and the\\r\\n      control eyes. The 12-month exam also measured visual function with preferential-looking\\r\\n      techniques.

The\\r\\n      potentially damaging effects of AR in diabetes were first discovered in the lens fiber cells.\\r\\n      In these cells, the enzyme catalyzes the reduction of high levels of glucose to sorbitol\\r\\n      through the polyol pathway and initiates a sequence of events that eventually results in\\r\\n      opacification of the lens. Because sorbitol (a sugar alcohol) and fructose (a subsequent\\r\\n      product of glucose metabolism) cannot readily diffuse across cell membranes, they become\\r\\n      trapped in lens fiber cells. There they accumulate at unusually high levels and exert a\\r\\n      significant osmotic stress, causing an influx of water and swelling of the lens fibers. Major\\r\\n      electrolytic and osmotic changes then occur that lead to lens opacity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      More recently, the detection of AR in the pericytes of retinal capillaries -- cells that are\\r\\n      involved very early in the evolution of diabetic retinopathy -- suggests that this enzyme may\\r\\n      also play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Scientists now know that AR is present\\r\\n      in nerve tissue, and they speculate that in diabetes it induces the depletion of myo\\r\\n      -inositol, which leads to the lessening of nerve conduction velocity in diabetic neuropathy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Chemicals that inhibit aldose reductase have proved effective in preventing damage to the\\r\\n      lens, in preventing thickening of retinal capillary basement membranes in diabetic animals,\\r\\n      and in improving nerve conduction velocity values in patients with diabetic neuropathy.\\r\\n      Therefore, it is possible that AR inhibitors also may be able to prevent, delay, or halt the\\r\\n      development or progression of diabetic retinopathy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      To test this hypothesis, an AR inhibitor developed by Pfizer Inc., sorbinil, was studied in\\r\\n      this clinical trial.

The only treatment that seemed at all promising in preventing\\r\\n      visual loss from BVO was laser photocoagulation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Approximately 500 patients were enrolled in the study. One-half were randomly assigned to\\r\\n      treatment with argon laser photocoagulation; the other one-half remained untreated as\\r\\n      controls. For BVO with or without neovascularization, scatter treatment of 100 to 400 laser\\r\\n      burns was applied in the drainage area of the occluded vein site, avoiding the fovea and\\r\\n      optic disc. Individual laser burns were 200 to 500 microns in diameter with an exposure time\\r\\n      of 0.1 to 0.2 seconds. For macular edema, burns of 50 to 100 microns in diameter with\\r\\n      exposure time of 0.05 to 0.1 seconds were used. A fluorescein angiogram less than 1 month old\\r\\n      had to have been available for each patient. Treatment was performed under topical anesthesia\\r\\n      using the argon laser to achieve a grid pattern over the area of capillary leakage identified\\r\\n      by fluorescein in the macular region. Photocoagulation was extended no closer to the fovea\\r\\n      than the edge of the foveal avascular zone and did not extend peripherally beyond the major\\r\\n      vascular arcade. The efficacy of treatment was judged on the basis of visual acuity\\r\\n      measurements as well as assessment of the subsequent development of neovascularization and/or\\r\\n      vitreous hemorrhage. Patients were followed for at least 3 years.\\r\\n    EstrogensN/AN/AFemale',\n",

The Macular Photocoagulation Study (MPS) Group,\\r\\n      sponsored by the National Eye Institute, demonstrated that laser treatment is effective for\\r\\n      recurrent subfoveal CNV (that extends into the center of the macula) after laser treatment\\r\\n      and for selected patients with subfoveal CNV who had no prior treatment. More recently,\\r\\n      photodynamic therapy with verteporfin was shown to reduce the risk of moderate and server\\r\\n      loss of vision in selected patients with subfoveal neovascularization associated with AMD.\\r\\n      Choroidal neovascularization due to OHS affects adults of working age and may pose a lifelong\\r\\n      risk of blindness to people who have characteristic scars (\"histo spots\") in the macula. It\\r\\n      has been estimated that 2,000,000 people who live or have lived in the region of the United\\r\\n      States in which histoplasmosis is endemic have characteristic histo spots and that 100,000 of\\r\\n      them will lose vision in one or both eyes due to CNV. Fortunately, the effectiveness of laser\\r\\n      photocoagulation for treating CNV due to OHS that is not subfoveal (i.e., not extending into\\r\\n      the center of the macula) also has been demonstrated by the MPS Group in two randomized\\r\\n      clinical trials. However, treated patients are at risk of subfoveal recurrence, and laser\\r\\n      treatment cannot be applied to these patients or to other patients with OHS who present with\\r\\n      subfoveal CNV in the absence of prior laser treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Recently, alternative therapies to laser photocoagulation and photodynamic therapy have been\\r\\n      proposed for the management of CNV and are intended to increase the chance of stabilizing or\\r\\n      improving vision at a greater rate than with observation. The most promising of these\\r\\n      alternatives at this time is surgical removal of the neovascular lesion, i.e., submacular\\r\\n      surgery. The rationale for this surgical approach is that removal of the CNV may halt\\r\\n      enlargement of the visual defect, spare photoreceptors in the central macula, and allow\\r\\n      adjacent ocular structures to function normally. Data regarding the effectiveness of this\\r\\n      approach is limited to reports of case series which suffer from the absence of untreated\\r\\n      controls, limited number of cases evaluated, or lack of long term follow-up to assess the\\r\\n      impact of recurrent CNV, delayed atrophy of the outer retina, and adverse outcomes such as\\r\\n      cataract and retinal detachment, requiring additional treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Submacular Surgery Trials comprise a set of multicenter, randomized clinical trials with\\r\\n      the goal of determining whether surgical removal of subfoveal CNV stabilizes or improves\\r\\n      vision more often than observation. A total of 19 clinical centers collaborated in conducting\\r\\n      a clinical trial for patients with neovascular OHS and idiopathic CNV (Group H protocol). The\\r\\n      target sample size for the Group H protocol was 250 participants to be enrolled and followed\\r\\n      for 4 years.

Occlusion therapy is subject to problems of compliance, due to the child's dislike\\r\\n      of wearing a patch for visual, skin irritation, and social/psychological reasons. There is\\r\\n      evidence that compliance may be one of, if not, the most important determinant of success of\\r\\n      amblyopia therapy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      An alternative treatment, drug therapy with a cycloplegic drug (atropine) that dilates the\\r\\n      pupils and blurs the image seen by the sound eye, has been known for almost a century. This\\r\\n      method has been widely used for the management of occlusion treatment failures and for\\r\\n      maintenance therapy. However, it has seen little use as a primary treatment for amblyopia.\\r\\n      Clinical experience has found that it has a high acceptability to patients and parents, and\\r\\n      hence high compliance. In addition to its acceptability, pharmacologic therapy has the known\\r\\n      advantage over occlusion of providing a wider visual field with both eyes, which may have\\r\\n      safety and other functional implications. There is also clinical and laboratory evidence\\r\\n      suggesting that drug therapy may maintain and improve the ability to see with both eyes\\r\\n      (binocularity).\\r\\n\\r\\n      Available data suggest that the success rate with drug therapy is as good as, if not better\\r\\n      than, the success rate with occlusion therapy for mild to moderate degrees of amblyopia. If\\r\\n      this is true, for many children with amblyopia, drug therapy may be the preferred initial\\r\\n      therapy since it appears to be more readily accepted by the children and parents. Despite\\r\\n      data to support the use of drug therapy as a primary therapy for amblyopia, it has gained\\r\\n      only limited use among pediatric ophthalmologists. A definitive study comparing the outcomes\\r\\n      from occlusion therapy and drug therapy is justified in order to determine if new practice\\r\\n      guidelines for treatment of amblyopia are needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Regardless of whether the trial determines that one therapeutic approach is better than the\\r\\n      other, the data that are collected will provide valuable information about the course of\\r\\n      amblyopia treatment that is not presently available.

Recent evidence points to a role for glutamatergic dysregulation in\\r\\n      schizophrenia, as well as important differences between conventional agents and clozapine in\\r\\n      effects upon glutamatergic systems. D-cycloserine, a partial agonist at the glycine\\r\\n      modulatory site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, improves negative symptoms when\\r\\n      added to conventional agents and worsens negative symptoms when added to clozapine. High-dose\\r\\n      glycine also improves negative symptoms and has provided preliminary evidence suggesting that\\r\\n      glycine improves negative symptoms when added to clozapine. Serum concentrations of glycine\\r\\n      predicted response to both high-dose glycine and D-cycloserine. Both clozapine and\\r\\n      D-cycloserine may improve negative symptoms by activation of the glycine modulatory site of\\r\\n      the NMDA receptor complex. Because D-cycloserine is a partial agonist, it may act as an\\r\\n      antagonist at the glycine site in the presence of clozapine, whereas the full agonist,\\r\\n      glycine, would not be expected to worsen negative symptoms in the presence of clozapine.\\r\\n\\r\\n      This study proposes to administer a fixed-dose of D-cycloserine, glycine, or placebo added to\\r\\n      clozapine in 45 patients with schizophrenia.

The long-term goal of this study is to evaluate a new\\r\\n      approach for healing a chronic wound. Current methods of applying cytokines as a topical\\r\\n      protein to treat chronic wounds result in an inadequate response. PDGF-B, a growth factor\\r\\n      associated with wound healing, might dramatically enhance wound healing when produced in\\r\\n      large quantities in the wound bed via adenovirus-mediated gene overexpression by the cells of\\r\\n      the wound bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      This study consists of two trials. The goal of Trial A, a dose-escalation trial, is to\\r\\n      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PDGF-B/Ad5, an adenovirus vector designed to\\r\\n      overexpress PDGF-B, with respect to local and systemic toxicity and biologic feasibility. The\\r\\n      primary objective is to evaluate the acute safety, both local and systemic, of an intra-ulcer\\r\\n      injection of PDGF-B/Ad5, thereby determining the recommended dose. Upon evaluating patients,\\r\\n      they will be treated with a single intra-ulcer injection of PDGF-B/Ad5 in the wound. Patients\\r\\n      will receive only one dose, which will be administered during a 72-hour inpatient stay in a\\r\\n      research unit at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\n      This study will use a standard three-six dose-escalation scheme. The MTD is defined as the\\r\\n      highest dose for which fewer than two of six subjects experience a severe adverse reaction.\\r\\n      Each patient will be closely monitored for clinical adverse reactions resulting from\\r\\n      treatment with PDGF-B/Ad5. Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer\\r\\n      Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria Scale.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The primary objective of Trial B is to evaluate the safety and biologic feasibility of the\\r\\n      MTD of PDGF-B/Ad5 reported in Trial A in a standard 24-week trial for treatment of a venous\\r\\n      leg ulcer. For this study, 15 consecutive patients will be treated using the MTD. All\\r\\n      patients will receive a single intra-ulcer injection of PDGF-B/Ad5 and a limb compression\\r\\n      bandage to be changed weekly.Study participants will be followed for 24 weeks, which is the\\r\\n      length of most FDA-approved venous leg ulcer trials.\\r\\n    BuprenorphineN/AN/AAll\",\n",

 Autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica.\\r\\n      \\n      Clinical trials of estrogen/progestin replacement therapy (HRT) and a bisphosphonate,\\r\\n      alendronate (ALN), have demonstrated that both are effective in causing gains in bone mass\\r\\n      and preventing bone loss and fractures in postmenopausal women. The FDA has approved both\\r\\n      these drugs for prevention and treatment of fractures, and both are widely used in clinical\\r\\n      practice. Because both are approved and effective, and they work by different mechanisms,\\r\\n      many patients and their physicians ask whether both should be taken in combination,\\r\\n      particularly in cases of severe disease. The question is asked frequently because of the high\\r\\n      incidence of osteoporosis among women and the need for long-term prevention and treatments\\r\\n      that often last decades.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Indeed, physicians are using ALN and HRT together without adequate scientific support for the\\r\\n      assumption that the combination is more effective than either given alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Clinical trials are now underway to test conventional doses of HRT given as conjugated equine\\r\\n      estrogens (CEE), 0.625 mg/day or its equivalent, combined with ALN, 10 mg/day. However,\\r\\n      researchers are not studying the bone-sparing effectiveness of the combined administration of\\r\\n      ALN and low-dose continuous HRT given as CEE, 0.3 mg/d, along with medroxyprogesterone, 2.5\\r\\n      mg/d (MP). This low-dose continuous HRT regimen is attractive because of better convenience,\\r\\n      better patient tolerance, and reduced risk of breast cancer and other safety concerns\\r\\n      associated with conventional higher doses. Further, we have recently demonstrated that the\\r\\n      bone-sparing effect of this regimen is comparable to that of higher doses.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The long-term objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the combined therapy\\r\\n      shows a greater bone effect than does either treatment given alone. Our specific aim is to\\r\\n      conduct a 3.5 year, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of low-dose, continuous HRT\\r\\n      combined with alendronate, 10 mg/d (ALN), in three groups (72 people per group) of\\r\\n      estrogen-deprived postmenopausal women over age 60. We will give Group 1 low-dose HRT, Group\\r\\n      2 ALN, and Group 3 both low-dose HRT and ALN. We will give calcium and vitamin D supplements\\r\\n      to people in all three groups.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The primary outcome measures will be spine bone mineral density (SpBMD) and total hip bone\\r\\n      mineral density (HipBMD) measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Secondary\\r\\n      outcome measures will be total body bone mineral content and forearm bone mineral content. In\\r\\n      addition, we will perform studies to characterize the mechanism of the effects of these\\r\\n      regimens. These studies will consist of measurements of urinary bone resorption markers,\\r\\n      serum bone formation markers, calcium excretion, calcium absorption, and application of a\\r\\n      model developed in our laboratory to estimate and compare the magnitudes of the anabolic\\r\\n      effects (if any) of all three interventions on SpBMD and HipBMD.\\r\\n\\r\\n      We have reported data showing that both agents have an anabolic effect on bone in humans,\\r\\n      meaning that they cause an increase in bone mass beyond that explained by a remodeling\\r\\n      transient brought about by reduction in bone remodeling rates. Further, research has shown\\r\\n      that HRT and ALN affect bone by different mechanisms. Thus, this combination may have an\\r\\n      additive effect on bone resulting in bone gain beyond that previously seen with other\\r\\n      interventions. This project will provide much-needed information to physicians and their\\r\\n      patients on the benefits and safety of this combination regimen so that they can make\\r\\n      \"evidence-based\" decisions on the choice of interventions to prevent and treat osteoporosis.\\r\\n    BuprenorphineN/A55 YearsAll',\n",

Although NSAIDs are useful for pain\\r\\n      management, recent studies have not found NSAIDs to be better than acetaminophen for the\\r\\n      treatment of painful knee OA. The relative lack of efficacy and possibility of accelerated\\r\\n      disease progression, coupled with the known gastrointestinal risks of these medications,\\r\\n      especially to the elderly, have led us to reevaluate NSAIDs as the first-line medical therapy\\r\\n      for osteoarthritis. Our dominant NSAID-based approach to this disease may be resulting in\\r\\n      unnecessary costs, unnecessary toxicity, and accelerated disability.\\r\\n\\r\\n      These data allow us to hypothesize that NSAIDs, by inhibiting pain and inflammation in\\r\\n      osteoarthritic joints, may cause or encourage people with OA to overuse damaged joints,\\r\\n      resulting in accelerated joint degeneration and joint replacements at an earlier time or,\\r\\n      alternatively, that treatment with NSAIDs may accelerate joint damage by altering cartilage\\r\\n      metabolism and inhibiting joint healing. We further hypothesize that anti-inflammatory\\r\\n      therapy with NSAIDs results in toxicities that lead to increased comorbidity and higher\\r\\n      medical care use compared to analgesic therapy for OA.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The specific aims of our study are to determine if (1) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug\\r\\n      therapy accelerates joint degeneration compared to analgesic medications; and (2)\\r\\n      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy results in greater comorbidity and higher medical\\r\\n      care costs and use compared to simple analgesic medication. To accomplish these aims, we will\\r\\n      randomize 200 people with knee OA and 200 people with hip OA, defined by a Kellgren and\\r\\n      Lawrence x-ray grade of 2 or 3, currently on NSAIDs, to either NSAIDs at their current dose\\r\\n      or acetaminophen up to 4000 mg/day for 4 years.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Primary outcome measures will be the rate of radiographic progression, and pain and\\r\\n      disability in the two groups. Secondary outcome variables will include medical care use, time\\r\\n      to joint replacements, and medication side-effect profiles. We will separately identify and\\r\\n      describe those clinical, demographic, and radiographic variables that predict accelerated\\r\\n      progression in each group by multivariate analyses. By these methods, we will determine the\\r\\n      long-term outcome of NSAID therapy versus analgesic therapy for the treatment of clinical OA\\r\\n      of the knee and hip.

We\\r\\n      hypothesize that the effect of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is due\\r\\n      to the inhibition of aminoimidazole-carboxamide ribotide transformylase, a folate-dependent\\r\\n      enzyme that catalyzes the last step in the de novo biosynthesis of inosine monophosphate. The\\r\\n      resulting accumulation of aminoimidazole carboxamide riboside inhibits adenosine deaminase,\\r\\n      therefore interfering with normal adenosine metabolism. It is well known that children with\\r\\n      adenosine deaminase deficiency have severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome. This suggests\\r\\n      that adenosine deaminase activity is key to immune competence and is associated with the\\r\\n      mechanism of efficacy in methotrexate therapy of rheumatoid arthritis.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Several studies indicate that supplemental folinic acid (5-formyltetrahydrofolate) used in\\r\\n      large doses during low-dose methotrexate therapy for rheumatoid arthritis causes a flare in\\r\\n      joint inflammation. However, supplemental folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid) does not lessen\\r\\n      the efficacy of the therapy. We further hypothesize that if methotrexate efficacy is driven\\r\\n      by aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide transformylase inhibition, folic acid supplementation\\r\\n      should not alter urinary levels of aminoimidazole carboxamide, adenosine, and deoxyadenosine,\\r\\n      while folinic acid supplementation should prevent the accumulation of these compounds.\\r\\n\\r\\n      We will test our hypotheses both in people with rheumatoid arthritis and in Lewis rat\\r\\n      adjuvant arthritis. Our objectives include: (1) determining if the dose level of methotrexate\\r\\n      that is clinically optimal in the treatment of Lewis rat adjuvant arthritis interferes with\\r\\n      normal adenosine metabolism; (2) determining the effectiveness of drugs that interfere with\\r\\n      adenosine metabolism (deoxycoformycin, aminoimidazole carboxamide, and aminoimidazole\\r\\n      carboxamide with a suboptimal dose of methotrexate) in Lewis rat adjuvant arthritis; and (3)\\r\\n      determining whether supplemental folic acid and folinic acid during methotrexate therapy\\r\\n      normalize adenosine metabolism in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

A large body of\\r\\n      autopsy and pathologic evidence had accumulated showing that atherosclerosis, including fatty\\r\\n      streaks, increased surface involvement, and advanced microscopic lesions, began in childhood.\\r\\n      Blood cholesterol levels tracked from childhood to adulthood, with tracking correlations\\r\\n      ranging from .6 to .8. Therefore, a high proportion of children with high levels of\\r\\n      cholesterol have high levels as adults. Family clustering of risk factors had also been\\r\\n      reported. Studies showed 2-3 times increased prevalence of coronary heart disease in adult\\r\\n      relatives of children with high cholesterol compared to children with normal cholesterol, and\\r\\n      2.2 times increased prevalence in high cholesterol in children who had a parent or\\r\\n      grandparent with premature coronary heart disease compared with children who did not have a\\r\\n      family history of premature heart disease. Finally, there was high likelihood that\\r\\n      environmental influences on coronary heart disease risk factors had their behavioral\\r\\n      antecents in childhood. Thus, dietary habits which contributed toward elevated blood\\r\\n      cholesterol levels were likely to have developed early in life, and it was hoped that\\r\\n      behavioral change achieved during childhood was likely to persist into adulthood.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Although numerous studies had shown that dietary modification could lower blood cholesterol\\r\\n      levels in adults, only a few studies had shown this effect in children, and none were\\r\\n      long-term. Furthermore, the impact on long-term growth and development in children had not\\r\\n      been studied. Concerns were raised about the safety of cholesterol-lowering diets in\\r\\n      children, particularly during peak growing years. These concerns included possible deficits\\r\\n      in growth and nutrient adequacy, and potential adverse psychological effects. This paucity of\\r\\n      data was a potential barrier to active prevention measures. To fill this gap in knowledge,\\r\\n      the DISC trial, a randomized, controlled clinical trial, tested the efficacy and safety of\\r\\n      long-term dietary intervention for reduction of serum LDL-C levels in children during\\r\\n      puberty.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the feasibility study, children of both sexes, ages 8 to 10 at baseline starting in 1987,\\r\\n      were randomized to either a control group or to a usual care group for whom more intensive\\r\\n      dietary intervention for the child and the family was directed. The feasibility study lasted\\r\\n      16 months. The full-scale trial began in December 1988 with the randomization of a total of\\r\\n      663 children. At baseline, mean LDL-C levels, nutrient intakes, anthropometric measurements,\\r\\n      nutritional biochemical levels, and psychosocial measures were similar in the two groups. The\\r\\n      intervention group was assigned to a series of group and individual sessions to teach the\\r\\n      children and their families to follow a diet containing 28 percent of calories as total fat,\\r\\n      dietary cholesterol intake less than 75 mg/1000 kcal, and up to 9% of calories from\\r\\n      polyunsaturated fat. The diets were designed to meet nutritional requirements of growing\\r\\n      children. The usual care group was provided a packet of general dietary information only. The\\r\\n      primary efficacy outcome was a difference in changes in LDL-C levels between the two groups\\r\\n      at 36 months.

More recently, the emphasis has been on increasing CPR\\r\\n      capability through the development of prehospital emergency care systems and the involvement\\r\\n      of the lay public in the provision of CPR. The effectiveness of this technique in the\\r\\n      prehospital setting has been demonstrated in several community studies of patients in cardiac\\r\\n      arrest where survival rates ranged from 11-17 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Additionally, for patients in ventricular fibrillation, the proportion of patients discharged\\r\\n      alive ranged from 14-30 percent in five cities where the outcome of EMS programs has been\\r\\n      examined. These successes, however, concealed many failures in which CPR could not reverse\\r\\n      death even though correctly applied within established periods between arrest and\\r\\n      resuscitation. However, considerable potential existed for improving CPR techniques and for\\r\\n      making additional inroads towards the estimated 100,000 deaths each year in the United States\\r\\n      that could be reversed through the widespread application of CPR.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A major goal of CPR is to maintain adequate peripheral perfusion (particularly the cerebral\\r\\n      and coronary circulation) during cardiac arrest while attempts are being made to restore\\r\\n      normal cardiac function. Maneuvers which increase intrathoracic pressure, such as total\\r\\n      airway occlusion during chest compression and abdominal compression by binding, have been\\r\\n      shown to increase carotid blood flow in the dog.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Sixteen periods of conventional CPR followed by SC-V CPR and return to conventional CPR were\\r\\n      studied in 11 cases of in-hospital cardiac arrest at Johns Hopkins University. The findings\\r\\n      indicated that simultaneous compression and ventilation at high airway pressures (SC-V CPR)\\r\\n      greatly increased carotid flow velocity and radial artery pressure over values achieved with\\r\\n      conventional CPR. Maximum benefit was achieved in patients in whom standard or conventional\\r\\n      cardiopulmonary resuscitation was least effective. The increases in flow index noted with\\r\\n      simultaneous compression and ventilation were up to 274 percent of control.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The success of this new method of CPR had been demonstrated during in-hospital clinical\\r\\n      trials. The benefits of this method suggested the need to test the technique in the\\r\\n      prehospital setting where the vast majority of cardiac arrests occur.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Units of the Miami and Dade County Rescue Squads utilized the technique in a mid-point\\r\\n      cross-over design. One of the three shifts at each of the study rescue stations had been\\r\\n      thoroughly instructed in the SC-V CPR protocol.

Prevalence estimates exceed l5\\r\\n      percent in most adult populations. Further, the results of the Hypertension Detection and\\r\\n      Follow-up Program (HDFP) demonstrated the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy even at the\\r\\n      90-l05 mmHg level, which comprises 72 percent of the total hypertensive population. The Joint\\r\\n      National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure\\r\\n      recommended treatment of mild hypertension by pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic therapy to\\r\\n      the lowest diastolic pressure consistent with safety and tolerance. The recommendation was\\r\\n      consonant with the goal blood pressure guidelines for those with baseline pressures from\\r\\n      90-99 mmHg. Hence, there appeared to be a growing consensus that reduction of blood pressure\\r\\n      to levels as low as 80 mmHg might be desirable for optimal cardiovascular health. The Joint\\r\\n      National Committee further recommended that, in young patients with uncomplicated mild\\r\\n      hypertension, the benefits from pharmacologic therapy must be weighed against the cost,\\r\\n      inconvenience, and possible side effects. There was, therefore, a growing concern over the\\r\\n      need for pharmacologic management of hypertension and the public health implications of such\\r\\n      a course of action. These recommendations toward intervention in mild hypertension set a firm\\r\\n      basis for the primary prevention of hypertension.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The association between obesity and elevated blood pressure was widely recognized. Among\\r\\n      hypertensive individuals, numerous studies had shown that short term weight reduction by\\r\\n      caloric restriction resulted in a reduction of blood pressure. Results of several reports of\\r\\n      long-term follow-up of weight reduction efforts indicated that long-term control of weight at\\r\\n      levels compatible with the objectives of the HPT was feasible. A number of investigators had\\r\\n      achieved these levels one or more years after treatment despite minimal intervention efforts\\r\\n      during the follow-up period.\\r\\n\\r\\n      There was strong circumstantial evidence relating sodium intake to hypertension. Most\\r\\n      impressive evidence came from the study of the 'low-salt tribes', subsisting on a very low\\r\\n      sodium intake. They failed to develop hypertension, or even gradual rise of blood pressure\\r\\n      with age. Many studies published on the effect of lowering sodium intake on blood pressure of\\r\\n      hypertensive patients had been positive. In one investigation, blood pressure fell\\r\\n      approximately 9 (systolic)/6 (diastolic) mmHg when sodium intake was reduced from\\r\\n      approximately l80 to l00 mEq/day. Reduction of sodium intake to a level of 70-l00 mEq/day\\r\\n      appeared within the capability of most people and maintenance up to a period of two years had\\r\\n      been indicated with minimal follow-up procedures.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The role of potassium intake in the development and treatment of hypertension was less clear.\\r\\n      As noted above, primitive cultures studied epidemiologically had low sodium intakes\\r\\n      associated with low prevalence and incidence of hypertension but these cultures also consumed\\r\\n      higher levels of potassium. It has been suggested that the ratio of sodium to potassium may\\r\\n      be the most important determinant of blood pressure. Hygienic intervention to increase\\r\\n      potassium intake in free-living populations was the least studied of the procedures used in\\r\\n      the HPT. Potassium intakes > l00 mEq could be achieved without the use of dietary supplements\\r\\n      if individuals consumed large quantities of fruits and vegetables. This natural intake could\\r\\n      also be increased by use of potassium-based baking powder and seasonings.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The study was carried out by four clinical and two resource centers (a Coordinating Center\\r\\n      and a Nutrition and Educational Resource Center). It was to be Phase l of a long-term\\r\\n      intervention trial to determine whether development of hypertension could be prevented in a\\r\\n      population at special risk. The initial phase of the study was directed towards testing the\\r\\n      feasibility of the intervention, alternative modes of recruitment, quantification of sodium\\r\\n      and potassium intake, trends in blood pressure, and the pre-testing of various study\\r\\n      procedures.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Each of the four clinical centers recruited 200 or more eligible 25 to 49 year old\\r\\n      individuals (total 841), either identified through any of a number of multiple community\\r\\n      sources, or through an index of hypertensive cases.

Serious arrhythmias, occurring with or without evidence\\r\\n      of new infarction, are a common cause of death in this population. Theoretically, an agent\\r\\n      which (1) can block the sympathetic nervous activity thought to be involved in precipitating\\r\\n      sudden death and (2) has non-neurogenic antiarrhythmic properties would be of value to people\\r\\n      with coronary heart disease. Propranolol, like other beta- blocking agents, has these as well\\r\\n      as other properties and therefore might be expected to prevent or retard complications of\\r\\n      coronary heart disease such as serious arrhythmias. This would be reflected in a decrease in\\r\\n      mortality due to coronary heart disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A workshop on chronic antiarrhythmic therapy reviewed contemporary experimental data and\\r\\n      clinical practice and recommended that a clinical trial be undertaken to clearly show the\\r\\n      effects of beta-blocking drugs on mortality.

These are not the only risk factors associated with premature development of CHD,\\r\\n      but these factors are modifiable and provide a strong expectation that a reduction of these\\r\\n      factors should have a beneficial result of reducing the rate of development of premature\\r\\n      heart attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A multifactor approach to risk factor reduction closely resembles the type of intervention\\r\\n      that would be carried out by a physician in his treatment of a patient. The general concept\\r\\n      for such a trial was endorsed by the Arteriosclerosis Task Force in its 1970 report to the\\r\\n      Institute.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Volunteers were selected for the trial through a series of three screening visits, which\\r\\n      began in November 1973 and were completed by February 28, 1976.

Half\\r\\n      of the participants were assigned to the special intervention group and half to the usual\\r\\n      care group. The special intervention group was advised to follow an eating pattern designed\\r\\n      to result in a nutrient intake of 30 percent to 35 percent of calories from fat, with 10\\r\\n      (later 8) percent from saturated and 10 percent from polyunsaturated fat; approximately 300\\r\\n      (later 250) mg of cholesterol; and modification of carbohydrates as needed for individual\\r\\n      requirements. This group was also encouraged to cease cigarette smoking by a combination of\\r\\n      techniques, including counseling and audio-visual aids. Hypertension management was based on\\r\\n      a stepped-care program of weight reduction and drugs similar to that used in the Hypertension\\r\\n      Detection and Follow-up Program.

The primary endpoint was death due to coronary\\r\\n      heart disease. Men in both the special intervention and usual care groups returned for\\r\\n      assessment of changes in risk factor levels annually.

A total of 10,940 hypertensive participants were\\r\\n      randomized.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The primary hypothesis tested by the trial was that intensive blood pressure control under\\r\\n      stepped care for five years could significantly reduce mortality compared with that under\\r\\n      referred-care. Stepped-care was the method of treatment in HDFP clinics in which a diuretic\\r\\n      was given initially and additional antihypertensive agents were added in a time-structured,\\r\\n      stepwise fashion until goal blood pressure was achieved. Referred-care represented referral\\r\\n      to private physicians and other community sources of care. Participating in this study were\\r\\n      14 clinical centers, a coordinating center, ECG center, central laboratory, and monitoring\\r\\n      laboratory.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The clinical phase of the trial ended in May 1982. The project was extended into 1983 in\\r\\n      order to continue the surveillance of mortality and blood pressure control.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The trial was a randomized, non-blind, fixed sample trial with single intervention and\\r\\n      control groups. The intervention group received stepped care from the clinical trial clinics\\r\\n      (see Background, below), while those in the control group were referred to their own\\r\\n      physicians. Each community contributed both stepped-care and referred-care participants, but\\r\\n      for analysis purposes, the groups were pooled into two groups. The primary endpoint was\\r\\n      mortality. The effects of stepped- vs. referred-care were also assessed on intermediate and\\r\\n      secondary factors, including nosologic codes of specific causes of mortality, nonfatal\\r\\n      myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertensive heart disease, and EKG abnormalities.\\r\\n    Methotrexate55 Years18 YearsAll',\n",

Platelet aggregation is a large component in the formation of arterial\\r\\n      thrombi. Theoretically, an agent which prevents the aggregation of platelets would be of\\r\\n      value in people with coronary artery disease. Aspirin, in small doses, inhibits platelet\\r\\n      aggregation for prolonged periods of time, and therefore might be expected to prevent or\\r\\n      retard the occlusion of coronary arteries. This would be reflected in a decrease in the\\r\\n      incidence of myocardial infarction and a decrease in mortality due to coronary artery\\r\\n      disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Several studies had given preliminary evidence that regular administration of aspirin may be\\r\\n      of benefit to patients with known coronary artery disease. A National Heart and Lung\\r\\n      Institute-sponsored study, the Coronary Drug Project, ran a pilot trial of aspirin and\\r\\n      placebo in men with previous myocardial infarctions. Preliminary results from this trial\\r\\n      demonstrated its feasibility and led NHLBI to sponsor a more definitive controlled study of\\r\\n      the benefit of aspirin in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n      An Institute Planning Committee met four times between October 1974 and April 1975 and\\r\\n      developed a protocol, manual of operations, and data collection forms. Recruitment of\\r\\n      patients began in June 1975, with the first patient randomized on July 2, 1975. Patients who\\r\\n      were randomized had been seen at the AMIS Clinical Center for two initial visits and one\\r\\n      baseline visit and were free of any reasons for exclusion, such as the current use of\\r\\n      anticoagulants and a history of adverse reactions to aspirin. Patients took acetaminophen at\\r\\n      times when they would normally take aspirin.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Follow-up was for a minimum of 3 years, with each patient seen at 4-month intervals and\\r\\n      monitored for side effects and various nonfatal events, including cardiovascular problems.\\r\\n      The primary endpoint was mortality.

Both the surgical procedure\\r\\n      and the prior diagnostic procedures represented substantial costs in both monetary and\\r\\n      manpower terms; moreover, they entailed morbidity and mortality risks.\\r\\n\\r\\n      There existed an urgent need for reliable and quantitative information regarding the effects\\r\\n      of coronary artery surgery in patients with ischemic heart disease. To be meaningful, these\\r\\n      data had to be set into the perspective of the clinical course of such patients under medical\\r\\n      treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      This assessment presupposed a meaningful classification of these patients and of the\\r\\n      therapeutic interventions as well as evaluations of the effects of surgical and medical\\r\\n      regimens in terms of mortality, the quality of life, and objective hemodynamic and other\\r\\n      physiological measurements.

Initial projections of patient population numbers were underestimated;\\r\\n      therefore, five clinical centers were added to the trial in 1976.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The five clinical subgroups of patients in the randomized studies included: stable angina\\r\\n      with normal resting left ventricular function; stable angina with impaired left ventricular\\r\\n      function; post-myocardial infarction without angina; congestive heart failure due primarily\\r\\n      to ischemic heart disease; and patients previously asymptomatic who were discovered to have\\r\\n      serious coronary artery disease.

Asymptomatic\\r\\n      ischemia has been linked with sudden death or myocardial infarction. It is estimated that in\\r\\n      the United States over six million patients have chronic, symptomatic coronary heart disease\\r\\n      and up to three million of these may exhibit transient asymptomatic myocardial ischemia.\\r\\n      Asymptomatic ischemia is thought to be present in the majority of coronary heart disease\\r\\n      patients with stable angina pectoris, over 70 percent of all ischemic episodes being\\r\\n      asymptomatic.

Many\\r\\n      physicians believed that suppression of asymptomatic ischemia in patients with coronary heart\\r\\n      disease would reduce morbidity and mortality.

The ratio\\r\\n      between the percent reduction in coronary heart disease incidence and the percent reduction\\r\\n      in cholesterol levels associated with treatment in randomized trials, approximately 2:1, is\\r\\n      almost exactly that predicted by numerous observational epidemiologic studies of this\\r\\n      relationship. However, the clinical trials demonstrating that lowering LDL-cholesterol levels\\r\\n      reduces subsequent incidence of coronary heart disease events have been confined by and large\\r\\n      to middle-aged men with hypercholesterolemia as in the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary\\r\\n      Primary Prevention Trial (LRC-CPPT) or to men with established coronary heart disease as in\\r\\n      the Coronary Drug Project (CDP). Experimental confirmation that cholesterol-lowering\\r\\n      treatment is worthwhile after as well as before age 60 is lacking. Thus, although the\\r\\n      guidelines issued in October 1987 by the National Cholesterol Education Program\\'s (NCEP)\\r\\n      Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults did\\r\\n      not discriminate explicitly by age, the absence of direct evidence of efficacy led them to\\r\\n      allow room for physician judgment in applying their recommendations to older patients. This\\r\\n      uncertainty in the application of the NCEP guidelines to older men and women is a matter of\\r\\n      considerable consequence to the public health.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Epidemiologic studies suggest that the prognostic power of cholesterol levels diminishes with\\r\\n      advancing age. Subdivision of the participants in several cohort studies into those above or\\r\\n      below age 50 at entry shows that the increment in coronary heart disease risk per increment\\r\\n      in total or LDL cholesterol level is nearly always substantially lower in the older group. In\\r\\n      the Framingham Heart Study, the study with the most follow-up data beyond age 60, a 0.5\\r\\n      percent increment in the coronary heart disease incidence rate was estimated per 1 mg/dl\\r\\n      increment in plasma cholesterol level -- about 60 percent of the increment seen in\\r\\n      middle-aged men and women. However, the absolute numbers of potentially preventable coronary\\r\\n      heart disease deaths, 80 percent of which occur after age 65, and myocardial infarctions\\r\\n      attributable to high plasma cholesterol levels in Framingham and other observational studies\\r\\n      appear to increase with increasing age.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering drugs have been weakened by their limited\\r\\n      efficacy and acceptability to patients. In older patients, the administration of\\r\\n      cholesterol-lowering drugs may be further complicated by interactions with drugs taken for\\r\\n      other more pressing conditions. However, since the Food and Drug Administration approved the\\r\\n      HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, in September 1987, the agent has been efficacious\\r\\n      and well-tolerated by patients of all ages, and has been used increasingly widely.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In 1986, an ad hoc committee of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\'s\\r\\n      Atherosclerosis, Hypertension, and Lipid Metabolism Advisory Committee (AHLMAC) recommended a\\r\\n      randomized clinical trial of cholesterol-lowering using an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor in the\\r\\n      elderly.

       " 'temporal discounting delayed outcomes on opioid dependent outpatientsthe purpose of this study is to assess the degree in which opioid dependent outpatients discount the value of an additional maintenance dose of buprenorphine under differing states of opioid deprivation\\n        Please contact site for information.\\r\\n      \\n      BACKGROUND:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The prevalence of congestive heart failure increases progressively with advancing age, and\\r\\n      congestive heart failure is a major cause of mortality, morbidity, and diminished quality of\\r\\n      life in the elderly. Not only is congestive heart failure the most common cardiovascular\\r\\n      indication for hospitalization in patients 65 years or older, but frequent repetitive\\r\\n      hospitalizations, occurring in 30-50 percent of patients within three to six months of\\r\\n      initial discharge, create an imposing cost burden in caring for these patients. A pilot study\\r\\n      conducted at the grantee institution has shown that elderly congestive heart failure patients\\r\\n      at risk for early readmission can be identified at the time of initial hospitalization, that\\r\\n      up to 50 percent of readmissions are potentially preventable, and that a non-pharmacologic\\r\\n      treatment strategy consisting of patient education, medication analysis, discharge planning,\\r\\n      and enhanced follow-up is feasible and may reduce readmissions by 30 to 50 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the feasibility study, patients were randomly assigned to receive intervention or standard\\r\\n      care over a four year period. Patients were stratified into readmission risk categories of\\r\\n      high or moderate based on the presence of four independent risk factors for readmission\\r\\n      defined in a prior study at Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. The risk factors included: four or\\r\\n      more prior hospitalizations within the preceding five-year interval, previous history of\\r\\n      congestive heart failure, hypocholesterolemia, and right bundle-branch block on the admitting\\r\\n      electrocardiogram. The study intervention consisted of individualized patient education using\\r\\n      teaching materials specifically designed for the study; a careful review of medications with\\r\\n      specific recommendations designed to eliminate unnecessary drugs, decrease the number of\\r\\n      dosing intervals, improve compliance, and minimize side effects; early discharge planning;\\r\\n      and enhanced post-discharge follow-up. The primary endpoints were rehospitalization within 90\\r\\n      days after initial hospital discharge and the cumulative number of days hospitalized during\\r\\n      follow-up. Principal secondary endpoints included analyses of the effect of the study\\r\\n      intervention on compliance with prescribed medications, dietary sodium intake, incidence of\\r\\n      adverse drug reactions, patient knowledge and understanding of congestive heart failure,\\r\\n      patient-assessed quality of life, and the overall cost of medical care.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the full-scale trial, 140 patients were assigned to the control group which received all\\r\\n      standard treatments and services ordered by their physicians. A total of 142 patients were\\r\\n      assigned to the treatment group which received intensive education about congestive heart\\r\\n      failure and its treatment by an experienced cardiovascular research nurse, using a teaching\\r\\n      booklet developed by study investigators for geriatric patients with heart failure. Treatment\\r\\n      group patients also received individualized dietary assessment and instruction given by a\\r\\n      registered dietitian; consultation with social-service personnel to facilitate discharge\\r\\n      planning and care after discharge; an analysis of medications by a geriatric cardiologist who\\r\\n      made specific recommendations to eliminate unnecessary medications and simplify the overall\\r\\n      regimen; and intensive follow-up after discharge. The goals of follow-up were to reinforce\\r\\n      the patient\\'s education, ensure compliance with medications and diet, and identify recurrent\\r\\n      symptoms amenable to treatment on an outpatient basis. The primary outcome measure was\\r\\n      survival for 90 days without hospital readmission. Secondary endpoints included the number of\\r\\n      readmissions for any cause, the number of readmissions for congestive heart failure, the\\r\\n      cumulative number of days of hospitalization during follow-up, quality-of-life scores, and\\r\\n      the overall cost of medical care.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the \"End Date\" entered in\\r\\n      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.\\r\\n    Risperidone47 Years18 YearsAll',\n",
       " 'subjective psychomotor effects of combined alcohol nitrous oxidethe purpose of this study is to examine the subjective psychomotor and reinforcing effects of combined alcohol and nitrous oxide intake in healthy volunteers\\n        Please contact site for information.\\r\\n      \\n      BACKGROUND:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Coronary angioplasty is a non-surgical means of mechanical coronary artery revascularization\\r\\n      with the potential of reducing or eliminating severe coronary arterial narrowing which\\r\\n      results in myocardial ischemia. Since its innovation, the technique of coronary angioplasty\\r\\n      has undergone continuous refinement, so that a greater proportion of patients are now\\r\\n      eligible for this increasingly successful procedure. All clinical syndromes associated with\\r\\n      coronary artery disease, including chronic stable angina, silent myocardial ischemia,\\r\\n      unstable angina, and acute myocardial infarction, have been successfully treated with this\\r\\n      therapy, and often dramatic, favorable results are achieved. A persistent limitation of the\\r\\n      procedure has been the development of restenosis or the recurrence of coronary arterial\\r\\n      narrowing which usually occurs within six months of successful balloon dilatation, in spite\\r\\n      of current treatments such as anti-platelet agents. Several clinical trials have attempted to\\r\\n      identify pharmacologic regimens aimed at reducing the incidence of restenosis. With rare\\r\\n      exception, these trials have failed to detect a positive effect of any drug intervention.\\r\\n      Considering that restenosis reflects multiple factors, such as thrombosis, spasm, an\\r\\n      exaggerated response to injury, smooth muscle cells, platelets, and components of arachidonic\\r\\n      acid metabolism, multiple pharmacologic therapies have been employed, including aspirin,\\r\\n      warfarin, heparin, calcium antagonists, and steroids.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Investigators have directed attention to the potential role of marine polyunsaturated fatty\\r\\n      acids as potential inhibitors of restenosis. Dietary fish oil has been shown to inhibit\\r\\n      platelet aggregation and stimulate thromboxane synthesis, to reduce platelet vascular\\r\\n      interactions in atherosclerotic and injured blood vessels, and to inhibit diet-induced\\r\\n      atherogenesis in swine and in two species of monkeys. One study has shown that dietary fish\\r\\n      oil administered to pigs reduced platelet deposition and vasoconstriction in balloon catheter\\r\\n      induced carotid artery lesions. In addition, fish oil reduces blood and red cell viscosity\\r\\n      and also inhibits the function of monocytes which may be important in the pathogenesis of\\r\\n      atherosclerosis or in the vascular response to injury.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Early reports from human studies have been mixed, with most investigations failing to\\r\\n      demonstrate a positive effect. However, these trials have been limited to small numbers of\\r\\n      patients and typically lacked the rigor of a randomized, controlled clinical trial with a\\r\\n      hard endpoint and aggressive administration of fatty acids. N-3 PUFAs have been reported in\\r\\n      humans to increase prostacyclin formation and plasma fibrinolytic activity and to reduce\\r\\n      serum lipids, vascular reactivity, and the inflammatory potential of white blood cells at the\\r\\n      site of vascular injury, factors potentially involved in restenosis post-PTCA. Therefore,\\r\\n      there was some reason to believe that the addition of n-3 PUFAs to aspirin might have a\\r\\n      greater effect upon restenosis of treated vessels than aspirin alone. The basis of this study\\r\\n      rested with epidemiologic data from the Eskimos and Japanese that the ingestion of n-3 PUFAs\\r\\n      derived from cold water marine sources has a favorable effect in preventing the development\\r\\n      of coronary artery disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Randomized, double-blind. Patients at eight centers were assigned to receiving for six months\\r\\n      a daily dietary supplement of fish oil (ten 1.0-g capsules containing 80.6 percent ethyl\\r\\n      esters of omega-3 fatty acids providing 4.1 g eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and 2.8 g\\r\\n      docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) or to a control group receiving corn oil. The high dose of fish\\r\\n      oil approached the intake of the Greenland Inuits and was chosen with the hope of overcoming\\r\\n      any antagonistic effects of other fatty acids competing with those of EPA or DHA, such as\\r\\n      arachidonic acid or saturated fats. Two weeks prior to PTCA, patients began to take the\\r\\n      capsules. Aspirin was initiated 12 hours prior to PTCA and continued for six months. Dietary\\r\\n      counseling was provided prior to the two week intervention. Upon admission for PTCA and one\\r\\n      week following PTCA, expanded dietary counseling and instruction were given. Patients were\\r\\n      telephoned monthly to reinforce dietary information which included the American Heart\\r\\n      Association Phase I diet to reduce total fat to 30 percent of total energy. Diet was not\\r\\n      rigidly controlled. Recruitment began in August 1989 and ended in September 1992. Patients\\r\\n      exited from the trial upon completion of the protocol, including a final set of evaluations\\r\\n      at six months.

Short-term studies have documented the efficacy of\\r\\n      aspirin in preventing occlusion of saphenous vein bypass grants, preventing myocardial\\r\\n      infarction in patients with unstable angina, preventing transient ischemic attacks and stroke\\r\\n      in men with cerebral vascular disease, preventing occlusion of injured coronary arteries\\r\\n      following transluminal angioplasty and aiding in reducing myocardial infarction and total\\r\\n      mortality in patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy. Additionally, aspirin has been\\r\\n      effective in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction in subjects with known\\r\\n      coronary artery disease. The results of the Physicians' Health Study, a large-scale primary\\r\\n      prevention trial of aspirin in male physicians, have shown a decrease in myocardial\\r\\n      infarction, a non-significant increase in cerebral vascular events, and no difference in\\r\\n      overall mortality. However, few studies have addressed the efficacy of aspirin in vascular\\r\\n      diseases in women, and it is possible that the risk to benefit ratio may be different in\\r\\n      women.

At one end of this spectrum are patients with chronic stable\\r\\n      angina. When studied by coronary arteriography, such patients usually have obstructive\\r\\n      atherosclerotic disease with no evidence of fresh thrombosis. At the other end of the\\r\\n      spectrum are patients with acute myocardial infarction who present with a discrete episode of\\r\\n      prolonged chest pain accompanied by persistent ST-segment elevation. Such patients have a\\r\\n      high incidence of thrombotic coronary artery occlusion and the early intravenous\\r\\n      administration of thrombolytic agents has been shown to re-establish perfusion, limit the\\r\\n      extent of left ventricular dysfunction, and reduce both early or in-hospital and late or one\\r\\n      year mortality in this group.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Patients with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and unstable angina fall between these two\\r\\n      extremes. In the days and weeks following the onset of their disorder, their prognosis for\\r\\n      survival is better than that of patients with Q-wave myocardial infarction but worse than\\r\\n      that of patients with stable angina. Some patients with unstable angina progress to acute\\r\\n      myocardial infarction, and some of those with non-Q-wave infarction experience an unstable\\r\\n      course with reinfarction. Although others recover from the acute episode without subsequent\\r\\n      infarction or reinfarction, they frequently have severe obstructive coronary artery disease\\r\\n      and may be left with severe chronic stable angina. National summaries of hospital records\\r\\n      indicate that 750,000 patients are hospitalized yearly with unstable angina and 250,000 with\\r\\n      non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Once the results of creatine kinase measurements and serial electrocardiograms are available,\\r\\n      the identification of patients experiencing non-Q-wave myocardial infarction is relatively\\r\\n      simple. Identification of patients experiencing unstable angina is more difficult, since\\r\\n      numerous definitions of the condition have been offered. There is agreement, however, on two\\r\\n      important features of unstable angina. First, ischemia usually develops at rest or is\\r\\n      precipitated by minimal exertion; this differs from chronic stable angina, in which most\\r\\n      ischemic episodes are precipitated by physical exertion or strong emotion and the resultant\\r\\n      increase in myocardial oxygen demand. Second, ischemia is often associated with transient\\r\\n      ST-segment depression or elevation, in contrast to the persistent ST-segment elevation\\r\\n      characteristic of patients who develop Q-wave infarction.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It has been observed in small numbers of patients that, unlike patients with chronic stable\\r\\n      ischemia, patients with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction frequently have a\\r\\n      thrombus in a major coronary artery. Initial conventional therapy for unstable angina\\r\\n      consists of bed rest, oxygen, nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and aspirin. The\\r\\n      use of heparin is widespread but controversial. In many tertiary care hospitals, angiography\\r\\n      followed by PTCA is frequently performed, whereas in community hospitals patients are often\\r\\n      managed without angiography.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Prior to the TIMI III trial, patients with non-Q-wave myocardial infarction were usually\\r\\n      treated in the same way patients with Q-wave myocardial infarction were treated prior to the\\r\\n      advent of thrombolytic therapy. Neither heparin therapy nor thrombolytic therapy was\\r\\n      routinely employed, although knowledge of the role of thrombosis in some patients with this\\r\\n      condition had raised the possibility that one or both approaches might be helpful. Although\\r\\n      the early prognosis was favorable, awareness that the longer-term prognosis was as serious as\\r\\n      that following Q-wave myocardial infarction had led to increasing use of follow-up coronary\\r\\n      angiography to identify patients for whom PTCA or CABG might be useful. Whether or not\\r\\n      revascularization improved prognosis in these patients had not been established.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Previous studies of thrombolytic therapy for unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial\\r\\n      infarction were limited in number and size. The results suggested a benefit, but the\\r\\n      significance of this benefit and its relation to the risks and costs of therapy remained to\\r\\n      be answered.

In TIMI IIIA, patients received baseline angiograms and\\r\\n      were randomized in a double-blind manner to t-PA or placebo. All patients then received\\r\\n      intravenous heparin. The primary endpoint was the number of patients with a successful result\\r\\n      of therapy, defined as an improvement in TIMI perfusion by two grades (from 0 to 2 or 3, or\\r\\n      from 1 to 3) or a ten percent reduction in the severity of stenosis. The reduction was based\\r\\n      on a comparison between the baseline angiogram and the follow-up angiogram obtained 18 to 48\\r\\n      hours later. Patients in TIMI IIIA were enrolled over a nine month period. The total duration\\r\\n      was 24 months, including 12 months of data analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In TIMI IIIB, a total of 1,473 patients seen within 24 hours of ischemic chest pain at rest,\\r\\n      considered to represent unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (NQMI), were\\r\\n      randomized using a 2 x 2 factorial design to compare t-PA versus placebo as initial therapy\\r\\n      and an early invasive strategy consisting of early coronary arteriography followed by\\r\\n      revascularization when the anatomy was suitable versus an early conservative strategy\\r\\n      consisting of coronary arteriography followed by revascularization if initial medical therapy\\r\\n      failed. All patients were treated with bed rest, anti-ischemic medications, aspirin, and\\r\\n      heparin. The primary endpoint for the t-PA placebo comparison was death, myocardial\\r\\n      infarction, or failure of initial therapy at six weeks.

The focus of treatment in\\r\\n      the Coronary Intensive Care Unit was to prevent complications of acute myocardial infarction,\\r\\n      primarily arrhythmias leading to cardiac arrest and the treatment of cardiac arrest itself.\\r\\n      Acute phase morbidity and mortality related to loss of myocardium through infarction has not\\r\\n      changed. Post-discharge mortality and morbidity is, in large part, related to the occurrence\\r\\n      of congestive heart failure, secondary to loss of myocardium to infarction. Efforts to\\r\\n      preserve myocardium through pharmacologic intervention to limit demand, have not resulted in\\r\\n      significant benefit. It is now recognized that the infarction is not complete on\\r\\n      presentation, that it occurs as a wavefront over a period of four to six hours, and that in\\r\\n      80 to 90 percent of patients, infarction is due to thrombus in the infarct-related artery.\\r\\n      Therefore, reperfusion of the jeopardized myocardium during this window of four to six hours\\r\\n      could result in salvage of myocardium with resultant decrease in acute mortality as well as\\r\\n      acute and chronic morbidity and mortality from myocardial failure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The international streptokinase trials have established the feasibility of intravenous\\r\\n      coronary thrombolysis with streptokinase and demonstrated a decrease in acute morality\\r\\n      ranging from 18 percent to 50 percent, depending upon the interval between the onset of chest\\r\\n      pain and the initiation of thrombolytic therapy. Furthermore, preservation of ventricular\\r\\n      function, as reflected in ejection fraction, is greater with early administration.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The TIMI trial of tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), which is more clot-specific than\\r\\n      streptokinase, has substantiated the effectiveness. The initiation of thrombolytic therapy\\r\\n      with TPA as early as possible after the onset of symptoms offers an advantage, therefore, in\\r\\n      terms of both a reduction in acute mortality and salvage of ischemic myocardium.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Although thrombolysis is being performed at community hospitals or enroute to hospitals by\\r\\n      specially trained teams using helicopter transport, only one major study has been reported\\r\\n      which has systematically evaluated the benefit of early on-the-scene thrombolysis. This study\\r\\n      documented significant benefit in terms of salvage of myocardium over those patients in whom\\r\\n      thrombolytic therapy was initiated after arrival in the hospital, as a direct function of\\r\\n      time. This program used physicians in the ambulance to evaluate indications for and\\r\\n      contraindications to thrombolytic therapy in the field. The proposed study would evaluate the\\r\\n      ability of paramedics, under physician remote control, to accurately evaluate patients in the\\r\\n      field in terms of indications and contra-indications to thrombolytic therapy, and to assess\\r\\n      the possible benefit in terms of salvage of myocardium in those patients being transported to\\r\\n      the hospital by paramedic squads as opposed to those arriving by ordinary means.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      In Phase I, the paramedics took electrocardiograms of patients who met the definition of\\r\\n      cases and administered an abbreviated questionnaire. This phase tested the feasibility of\\r\\n      paramedics making a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction on the basis of clinical history\\r\\n      and with the support of computerized electrocardiogram, coming to an appropriate decision to\\r\\n      initiate thrombolytic therapy on the basis of the field database, and recognizing appropriate\\r\\n      contraindications to thrombolytic therapy with and without remote physician supervision. An\\r\\n      analysis was conducted of the pre-hospital selection of patients for thrombolytic therapy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Criteria for approval to move to Phase II included correct identification of appropriate\\r\\n      cases for treatment 75 percent of the time, less than five percent inappropriate cases or\\r\\n      with contraindications for thrombolytic therapy, and no more than one percent of the selected\\r\\n      cases found to have initial life-threatening hemorrhagic conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Beginning in November 1988, Phase II compared initiation of thrombolysis with tissue\\r\\n      plasminogen activator (TPA) in the field to initiation in the hospital. During Phase II,\\r\\n      which lasted for 24 months, one half of the patients meeting the case definition received\\r\\n      paramedic administration of intravenous thrombolytic therapy and one half received the same\\r\\n      pre-hospital diagnostic steps but treatment administered after transport to the hospital. The\\r\\n      360 patients with symptoms for six hours or less, no risk factors for serious bleeding, and\\r\\n      ST-segment elevation, were selected by paramedics and a remote physician for inclusion in the\\r\\n      trial. They were allocated to aspirin and alteplase treatment initiated before or after\\r\\n      hospital arrival. Intravenous sodium heparin was administered to both groups in the hospital.\\r\\n      Nineteen hospitals in the Seattle and King County areas participated. The primary endpoint\\r\\n      was a ranked composite score (combining death, stroke, serious bleeding, and infarct size).\\r\\n      The relation between time to treatment and outcome (composite score, infarct size, ejection\\r\\n      fraction, and mortality) was also assessed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In Phase II, a myocardial infarction registry was established to include all patients\\r\\n      hospitalized in the area with a discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. The\\r\\n      registry placed the trial findings in a community-based perspective and aided in the\\r\\n      interpretation of trial findings by assessing the proportion of cases seeking paramedic care\\r\\n      and determining the characteristics of these patients in contrast to those arriving at the\\r\\n      hospital by other means. The records of all patients admitted directly to coronary care units\\r\\n      in Seattle and King County were surveyed. Study personnel examined differences, if any,\\r\\n      between paramedic and other transport groups regarding clinical history, treatment,\\r\\n      complications, and hospital discharge rates. Of the cases in the registry, 300 who arrived at\\r\\n      the hospital by means other than paramedic transport were compared to the\\r\\n      paramedic-transported cases with respect to the incidence of new Q-wave infarction on the\\r\\n      first and last electrocardiogram, an interview to determine onset, severity, and duration of\\r\\n      symptoms, and reasons for choosing one type of care over the other during the emergency\\r\\n      situation.\\r\\n    RisperidoneN/AN/AAll',\n",

Early intervention and stroke prevention utilized\\r\\n      anti-coagulants such as coumadin and heparin. Results were largely equivocal due to the\\r\\n      diverse nature of the underlying pathogenesis and due to problems that offset potential\\r\\n      benefit. Emphasis gradually switched to aspirin and to other platelet anti-aggregant drugs\\r\\n      because of mounting evidence that micro-emboli were a major element in transient ischemic\\r\\n      attacks. Several studies have examined the potential benefit of aspirin in stroke prevention.\\r\\n      The exact dose of aspirin that was maximally beneficial with minimal side effects was not\\r\\n      completely established. There was evidence that low dose aspirin was as effective as higher\\r\\n      doses. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) made recommendations that if aspirin\\r\\n      were issued as a primary anti-thrombotic agent, the dose should be 325 mg daily, except in\\r\\n      patients with cerebrovascular disease in whom the lowest beneficial dose appeared to be one\\r\\n      gram per day. The ACCP also pointed out that the risk of bleeding was substantially greater\\r\\n      in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease and venous thromboembolism than in other\\r\\n      high risk groups requiring anticoagulation. It advised that anticoagulant therapy was not\\r\\n      needed, but that aspirin might be given at 325 mg per day.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Lovastatin is a fungal metabolite that inhibits 3-hydroxy, 3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A\\r\\n      reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis in human cells including the\\r\\n      liver. Inhibition of this pathway causes the cells to increase their low density lipoprotein\\r\\n      receptor numbers to compensate, causing a reduction in circulating low density lipoprotein\\r\\n      levels with a consequent drop in circulating plasma cholesterol levels. The drug also raises\\r\\n      high density lipoprotein levels significantly.

Pathological and clinical\\r\\n      studies have documented that graft obstruction during the perioperative period and the first\\r\\n      year is usually due to technical problems at surgery or thrombosis and occurs in about 15 to\\r\\n      20 percent of saphenous vein grafts. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin have been shown to\\r\\n      reduce these early graft occlusions by about 50 percent. In addition to thrombosis, during\\r\\n      the first year, most saphenous vein grafts undergo diffuse fibrosis and some distortion.\\r\\n      However, the significance of these changes is not known.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After the first year, lipid deposition and changes histologically similar to atherosclerosis\\r\\n      have been documented both in experimental studies and in human saphenous vein grafts patent\\r\\n      at one year completely occlude and an additional 30 percent narrow over a period of ten\\r\\n      years. These angiographic changes in the saphenous vein grafts correlate with high\\r\\n      LDL-cholesterol, low HDL-cholesterol and high apolipoprotein B levels. In experimental\\r\\n      animals, cholesterol deposition in the grafts has been substantially increased or decreased\\r\\n      by increasing or decreasing the saturated fats and cholesterol in the animal's diets. In\\r\\n      contrast to changes in the saphenous vein grafts, internal mammary artery grafts have shown\\r\\n      substantially lower rates of obstruction. The native vessels (both ungrafted vessels and\\r\\n      grafted vessels at distal or proximal sites), however, show evidence of progressive\\r\\n      atherosclerosis. The long-term follow-up of grafts also demonstrates thrombotic material and\\r\\n      even occlusive thrombus as part of acute events.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Progression of atherosclerotic lesions in grafts and native vessels lead to recurrent angina,\\r\\n      unaltered long-term survival and reduced efficacy of repeat CABG surgery. Johnson in an 11\\r\\n      year follow-up of 3,105 post-CABG patients, reported that about 15 percent of patients with\\r\\n      preoperative angina have recurrent angina at 1 year; with a further 6 percent developing\\r\\n      angina every subsequent year. In this study, patients with recurrent angina had twice the\\r\\n      mortality compared to those who were angina-free. Long-term follow-up of the VA Cooperative\\r\\n      Trial of CABG shows that the survival of the surgical group appears to be initially superior\\r\\n      compared to the medical group but this benefit is diminished by about ten years. This may\\r\\n      relate to graft obstruction and progression of native coronary atherosclerosis. Re-operation\\r\\n      in these patients carries a higher operative mortality risk and the results are less\\r\\n      impressive. It had been estimated that approximately 5 percent of all CABG surgery in 1984\\r\\n      were re-operations and that this percentage would double over the next decade. Therefore,\\r\\n      measures to prevent graft occlusion and progression of atherosclerosis in native vessels, if\\r\\n      successful, could have substantial clinical and economic importance by reducing mortality,\\r\\n      morbidity and the numbers of patients undergoing re-operations.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Apart from trials of aspirin and dipyridamole in post-CABG patients that demonstrated a\\r\\n      significant reduction in graft closure within the first year after surgery, there were no\\r\\n      large systematic studies of interventions in these patients. Graft occlusion has been shown\\r\\n      to correlate with high LDL-cholesterol and low HDL-cholesterol, and the severity of\\r\\n      atherosclerosis has been additionally shown to be related to cigarette smoking and increased\\r\\n      levels of coagulation factor. Therefore, lowering the LDL cholesterol (by diet and drugs),\\r\\n      and anti-thrombotic therapy with warfarin were logical choices for intervention.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Several studies suggested that CABG surgery relieved angina and improved overall quality of\\r\\n      life. However, in the available studies, CABG did not consistently appear to be associated\\r\\n      with an improvement in employment status, physical recreational activity, or life style. The\\r\\n      reasons for these results were not entirely clear and there was a need to identify the\\r\\n      biobehavioral and psychosocial factors that predicted successful adjustment after CABG.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The initiative was proposed by Institute staff and approved by the September 1985 National\\r\\n      Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The Request for Proposals was released in September\\r\\n      1985 and awards made in April 1987.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. All prospective participants\\r\\n      received active warfarin treatment for a month prior to randomization. Only participants\\r\\n      demonstrating a minimal reaction to warfarin and consuming over 90 percent of the prescribed\\r\\n      medication were randomized. Dietary modification to lower serum cholesterol, an exercise\\r\\n      program, and a smoking cessation program were implemented. Patients were randomly assigned in\\r\\n      a 2 X 2 factorial design in four treatment groups: aggressive LDL-C lowering with lovastatin\\r\\n      40 to 80 mg/d and, as necessary cholestyramine 8 mg/d to achieve and LDL-C of 60 to 85 mg/dl;\\r\\n      moderate LDL-C lowering with lovastatin 2.5 to 5 mg/d, with cholestyramin as needed, to\\r\\n      achieve a LDL-C of 130 to 140 mg/dl; warfarin 1 to 4 mg/d to achieve an INR of 1.8 to 2.0;\\r\\n      and warfarin-placebo. All participants were followed for five years, at the end of which\\r\\n      selective coronary and graft angiography was performed. The primary angiography endpoint was\\r\\n      the proportion of major SVG per patient that showed substantial reduction (0.06 mm or\\r\\n      greater) in lumen diameter. Biobehavioral studies were conducted in 750 participants.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Planning for the study began in April 1987 and a final protocol was developed by August 1988.\\r\\n      Patient recruitment has been completed.

       " 'effects of combined sevoflurane and nitrous oxide inhalationthe purpose of this study is to determine the effects of combined sevoflurane and nitrous oxide inhalation on mood psychomotor performance and the pain response in humans\\n        Please contact site for information.\\r\\n      \\n      BACKGROUND:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The management of patients with symptomatic coronary heart disease has evolved considerably\\r\\n      in the past twenty years with the application of invasive techniques in an ever increasing\\r\\n      proportion of patients.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With refinements in CABG surgery over the past twenty years, operative myocardial\\r\\n      revascularization is feasible in most patients with myocardial ischemia. Several multicenter,\\r\\n      randomized trials have been reported, comparing medical with surgical management in patients\\r\\n      with coronary artery disease. Based on the three largest trials and an extensive\\r\\n      observational literature, a consensus appears to be emerging regarding the circumstances\\r\\n      under which medical or surgical management appears to be the method of choice.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It is clear that CABG relieves angina in the vast majority of patients with severe symptoms.\\r\\n      It is also apparent that this procedure can be performed with very low risk by experienced\\r\\n      operative teams. Thus, CABG is indicated for patients with suitable coronary anatomy who have\\r\\n      severe angina refractory to medical therapy and those with significant obstruction of left\\r\\n      main coronary artery.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The timing of operative intervention in patients with less severe angina is a point of some\\r\\n      dispute at present. It is, however, apparent that certain categories of patients have\\r\\n      improved survival after elective bypass surgery. These categories include patients with left\\r\\n      main coronary stenosis, triple vessel disease with modestly impaired ventricular function,\\r\\n      and possibly other clinically defined high risk patients. The remaining patients with mild,\\r\\n      symptomatic coronary disease, it would appear, can afford to defer operative intervention\\r\\n      until such time as symptoms worsen and require palliation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Long-term information is available on some patients who had CABG in the early 1970s. By ten\\r\\n      years substantial progression of disease is present in both the native coronary circulation\\r\\n      and in the bypass grafts. Investigators have reported that as many as two-thirds of vein\\r\\n      bypass grafts are closed or narrowed and intrinsic coronary disease has progressed in as many\\r\\n      as one-half of non-bypassed vessels at 10 years following surgery. The timing of surgery in\\r\\n      less severely symptomatic patients, strategies to decrease disease progression in grafted\\r\\n      vessels and native circulation, and renewed interest in the use of the internal mammary\\r\\n      artery to revascularize the heart are very active research issues at present.\\r\\n\\r\\n      PTCA was first applied to human coronary disease in 1977. There have been major advances in\\r\\n      catheter design, balloon construction, and identification of both high and low risk patients\\r\\n      for this procedure. Experienced angioplasty teams can now successfully dilate severe lesions\\r\\n      in more than 90 percent of patients attempted. This success rate can be achieved with less\\r\\n      than one percent operative mortality and less than five percent myocardial infarction and/or\\r\\n      emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. However, as many as one-third of successfully\\r\\n      dilated patients will experience the return of angina within the following six months to one\\r\\n      year, reflecting restenosis of the dilated lesion. Most of these individuals can successfully\\r\\n      undergo a second dilatation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Thus, two quite effective interventions are available for patients with symptomatic coronary\\r\\n      artery disease sufficient to require palliation by some mechanical means. Each has strengths\\r\\n      and weaknesses. PTCA is relatively noninvasive, requires initially fewer hospital days and\\r\\n      less intensive care, and preserves veins and mediastinum for CABG should it be required\\r\\n      later. However, not all lesions present in a patient with multivessel disease can be dilated.\\r\\n      There is substantial risk of restenosis and recurrence of symptoms, and a small but finite\\r\\n      risk of having to undergo immediate CABG surgery following a failed PTCA, considerably\\r\\n      increasing the risk of the surgery. CABG surgery results in more complete revascularization\\r\\n      and relatively low short-term graft closure, and it can be done with an acute risk\\r\\n      approximately equal to PTCA. However, it is apparent that surgical intervention does not\\r\\n      change a patient\\'s propensity to atherosclerosis; in ten years two-thirds of grafts have been\\r\\n      compromised with atherosclerosis or thrombosis and there has been progression of\\r\\n      atherosclerosis in the native, non-bypassed coronary circulation in roughly one-half of the\\r\\n      patients. Second operations are considerably more difficult technically, carry a higher\\r\\n      operative risk, and result in less dramatic relief of symptoms. There is a substantial\\r\\n      population of patients with severe, symptomatic, multivessel coronary disease in whom it is\\r\\n      unclear whether PTCA or CABG should be applied first.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In September 1984, the Workshop on Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery recommended\\r\\n      consideration of a clinical trial involving surgery and angioplasty. An NHLBI Task Force,\\r\\n      established in January 1985, recommended that a clinical trial in multivessel coronary artery\\r\\n      disease be considered by the Institute. The Cardiology Advisory Committee unanimously\\r\\n      recommended the design and execution of a trial. In September 1985, the National Heart, Lung,\\r\\n      and Blood Advisory Council discussed this clinical trial initiative and recommended it\\r\\n      enthusiastically.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Patients who received coronary arteriography at the clinical units because of severe angina\\r\\n      or unstable angina, with or without antecedent myocardial infarction, were asked to\\r\\n      participate in the study. A total of 2,013 eligible patients who refused randomization and\\r\\n      422 who were ineligible on the basis of angiographic findings were asked to participate in\\r\\n      the follow-up registry. The remaining patients were then randomized, 914 to CABG and 915 to\\r\\n      PTCA, between August 1988 and August 1991. Baseline data included the clinical profile,\\r\\n      12-lead electrocardiogram, and information on coronary angiographic features, angina and\\r\\n      functional status, medications, risk factors, and quality of life. Initial revascularization\\r\\n      was performed within two weeks after randomization. Angiograms (baseline and sub study\\r\\n      directed at 1 year and 5 years), and ECG\\'s are interpreted by respective core laboratories.\\r\\n      Scheduled multiple stages of PTCA were counted as a single procedure. New interventional\\r\\n      devices, such as stents, were not used during the initial revascularization. Follow-up visits\\r\\n      were conducted at the clinics at weeks four through fourteen after study entry and at one,\\r\\n      three, and five years, with telephone contacts at six months and two and four years. The\\r\\n      importance of risk factor modification was emphasized throughout the study to the patients\\r\\n      and their primary physicians. The primary end point was mortality from all causes.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The trial has been extended through November 2002 to complete the minimum ten-year followup\\r\\n      on all BARI patients, determine the relative efficacy of PTCA versus CABG in subgroups of\\r\\n      women, Blacks, diabetics, and elderly, and assess the public health impact of BARI. In the\\r\\n      followup, all currently enrolled patients will have annual telephone interviews. At ten\\r\\n      years, the electrocardiogram will be obtained on all patients and blood lipid levels will be\\r\\n      performed on randomized patients only. All hospitalizations that occurred since the last\\r\\n      contact will be identified on the annual telephone contact. Angina will be assessed for the\\r\\n      preceding six weeks. At each patient contact, patients will be instructed in behavior\\r\\n      modification in the areas of smoking cessation, exercise, and diet. Angiographic studies will\\r\\n      also be conducted as part of the ten-year follow-up. The four centers which participated in\\r\\n      the first phase of these BARI activities will again conduct the angiograms. Patients will\\r\\n      consist of the established cohort drawn from the randomized participants who completed one\\r\\n      and five year angiograms.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A substudy of BARI, Study of Economics and Quality of Life (SEQOL), was initially funded by\\r\\n      the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to assess the impact of a specific revascularization on\\r\\n      quality of life, functional and economic (hospital and physician charges) outcomes in\\r\\n      patients randomized to BARI, and to examine factors other than treatments that affect these\\r\\n      outcomes. Beginning in July 1997, support for SEQOL was assumed by the NHLBI under grant\\r\\n      R01HL58324. The grant, ending in June 2002, extends the follow-up of the randomized SEQOL\\r\\n      substudy cohort (752 subjects surviving as of May 1, 1996) to ten years to study the\\r\\n      long-term determinants of cost and quality of life and to develop a model to project the\\r\\n      impact of technologic changes on outcomes and cost of CABG and PTCA.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the \"End Date\" entered in\\r\\n      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.\\r\\n    PrednisoneN/AN/AAll',\n",

The earliest lesion in the vascular system\\r\\n      is the fatty streak, characterized by an accumulation of lipids in the intima. These lesions\\r\\n      are present in the vessels of infants and young children. Whether these fatty streaks are\\r\\n      precursors of more complex lesions is controversial. However, fibrous plaques, intimal\\r\\n      lesions consisting of a central core of extracellular lipids covered with a cap of\\r\\n      fibromuscular tissue, are frequently seen in children by 15 years of age. In addition,\\r\\n      necropsy studies of United States battle casualties confirm the presence of advanced coronary\\r\\n      lesions in young adults. Thus, it appears that the atherosclerotic process is well\\r\\n      established in the American population by young adulthood.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Epidemiologic studies in adults have found that associated with the development of coronary\\r\\n      artery disease are a number of risk factors including age, sex, hypercholesterolemia,\\r\\n      hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes, a family history of coronary artery disease,\\r\\n      obesity, lack of physical activity, and perhaps coronary prone behavior. Of the modifiable\\r\\n      factors, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and cigarette smoking have the greatest\\r\\n      predictive value.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A small reduction of serum cholesterol levels in all children by a modest diet change, it has\\r\\n      been hypothesized, would reduce coronary heart disease. More severe dietary restriction, in\\r\\n      some cases in conjunction with medication, is recommended for very high-risk pediatric\\r\\n      populations only. In addition, surveillance of blood pressure, avoidance of cigarette smoking\\r\\n      and overweight, and regular physical exercise are prudent recommendations for all children.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The National Children and Youth Fitness Study (NCYFS) offered new standards for measuring\\r\\n      fitness, profiled youth exercise habits, and helped to explain the contribution of exercise\\r\\n      to fitness. Nationwide, 8,000 fifth- through twelfth-graders in 140 schools in 19 states\\r\\n      participated in the study between February and May 1984. Findings revealed that these youths\\r\\n      had substantially more body fat than their counterparts in the 1960's and that approximately\\r\\n      half of the students did not perform sufficient physical activity to maintain effective\\r\\n      cardiorespiratory functioning. Results from the 1985 national survey of drug use among high\\r\\n      school students indicate that most initial experiences with smoking occur before high school,\\r\\n      with 13 percent of students beginning prior to tenth grade. Substantial increases in smoking\\r\\n      occur between seventh and eighth grade and inner city Hispanic students show higher smoking\\r\\n      rates than white or Black inner city youth.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Although there is debate about the cut-off point at which children might be considered at\\r\\n      risk for coronary heart disease, it is estimated that 36-60 percent of children in the United\\r\\n      States exhibit at least one modifiable risk factor for coronary disease by the age of 12. The\\r\\n      nation's schools may provide an appropriate and efficient vehicle for reducing cardiovascular\\r\\n      risks in large populations. About 47 million children and young people attend some 115,000\\r\\n      public and private schools. These students are in school from 5 to 8 hours each day, 5 days\\r\\n      per week, for nearly 36 weeks per year. Furthermore, the school food services provide 20\\r\\n      percent or more of total daily caloric intake on school days for children who select the\\r\\n      school lunch program.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Currently, school-based health promotion programs are conceptualized as including curriculum\\r\\n      and related organizational factors that support healthy behavior. The existence of\\r\\n      comprehensive programs is limited throughout the nation. The results of numerous school-based\\r\\n      nutrition studies report changes in students' knowledge about nutrition. Several studies\\r\\n      based on social learning theory report changes in behavior and knowledge about nutrition.\\r\\n      Although health education interventions may succeed in increasing children's knowledge and\\r\\n      producing changes in behavioral intentions and behavior, the behavioral changes may not be\\r\\n      maintained unless the school environment and children's parents reinforce the intentions.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Substantial progress in the field of cigarette smoking prevention in youths has been made\\r\\n      during the past few years. Researchers have focused on the prevention of cigarette smoking\\r\\n      for several reasons. First, cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for such chronic\\r\\n      diseases as coronary heart disease, cancer, and emphysema. Second, cigarette smoking is the\\r\\n      most widespread form of drug dependence in our society. Third, cigarette smoking occurs\\r\\n      toward the very beginning of the developmental progression of substance abuse and\\r\\n      consequently is generally regarded to be one of the so-called 'gateway' substances.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A recent review indicated that the most promising cigarette smoking prevention approaches\\r\\n      focus on the psychosocial factors that promote initiation of cigarette smoking. Such\\r\\n      approaches fall into two general categories: (a) those that focus on the social influences\\r\\n      believed to promote substance use, and (b) those that provide coping skills training designed\\r\\n      to enhance personal and social competence. Results of a recent 24-month study involving 689\\r\\n      sixth-grade elementary students showed that youths who received both health information and\\r\\n      skills interventions had less intention to smoke and less cigarette use than youths who\\r\\n      received no intervention or health information alone. Prior studies using peer-led models\\r\\n      with seventh graders report similar results.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The research literature on the effects of physical activity promotion is sparse. One of the\\r\\n      few intervention studies on physical activity with school children to report increased\\r\\n      endurance fitness and reduced body fat associated with an intensive daily physical program is\\r\\n      the Australian Health and Fitness Study. This randomized, controlled trial was designed to\\r\\n      compare the effects of integrated physical activity and health education programs on body\\r\\n      fat, blood pressure, and endurance fitness in 10-year-old school children in primary schools\\r\\n      located in Adelaide. The Oslo Youth Study was successful in designing and implementing within\\r\\n      the school system a comprehensive health educational program involving grades 5-7. Positive\\r\\n      results were obtained in the intervention group relative to the reference group with\\r\\n      reductions in smoking onset, improved eating habits, and increased physical activity over a\\r\\n      two-year period.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Over the past ten years, school-based research studies have become more\\r\\n      theoretically-grounded and have employed more sophisticated research design strategies and\\r\\n      measurement techniques. The prevention of cigarette smoking has been the major focus of this\\r\\n      research. There is still considerable need to build the base of scientific knowledge about\\r\\n      the development of dietary, smoking, and exercise habits during childhood and about the\\r\\n      interventions that are effective in school settings.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      CATCH consisted of a three-and-a-half year feasibility study conducted from September 1987\\r\\n      through March 1991, the main trial beginning in April 1991, and the Tracking Study, in 1996 a\\r\\n      follow-up study to allow measurements on the cohort through ages 13 to 14 years. The purpose\\r\\n      of the feasibility study was to test the acceptability of the interventions and measurements\\r\\n      in 1,471 third, fourth, and fifth grade boys and girls, ages 7 to 11. The main components of\\r\\n      the Phase I intervention programs at the eight schools included classroom curricula for the\\r\\n      third, fourth, and fifth grades; home curricula designed to involve parents and children in\\r\\n      CATCH activities at home and family fun nights to enhance family involvement; a physical\\r\\n      activity program centered around a new physical activity curriculum; and a school nutrition\\r\\n      program for school food service directors and staff. Blood samples were obtained from 1,045\\r\\n      children during risk factor screening. Other measurements included blood pressure, height,\\r\\n      weight, triceps, and subscapular skinfolds. Nutrient intake was pilot-tested with an\\r\\n      interactive 24-hour recall approach, supplemented by food records, a home food inventory, and\\r\\n      follow-up calls to parents. Physical activity was measured with a physical activity interview\\r\\n      and the Caltrac motion sensor.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The main trial or Phase II, beginning in 1991 and ending in 1994, included two study groups,\\r\\n      an Intervention Group and a Control Group, with a total of approximately 8,000 students. The\\r\\n      measurement cohort included 5,107 students. The Intervention Group received a school-based\\r\\n      program consisting of the CATCH curriculum, the physical education program, the school food\\r\\n      service program, and programs to establish smoke-free schools. One-half of the Intervention\\r\\n      Group received the same school-based program plus a family-based program. The Control Group\\r\\n      received the usual health curriculum of the control schools but none of the CATCH\\r\\n      interventions. The primary endpoints at the school level were reduction in fat and saturated\\r\\n      fat in school lunches and increased moderate to vigorous activity in PE classes. The primary\\r\\n      endpoint at the student level was serum cholesterol change between the third and fifth\\r\\n      grades. Secondary endpoints included health knowledge, self-efficacy and behavioral skills\\r\\n      that related to the adoption and maintenance of cardiovascular health behaviors; dietary fat\\r\\n      intake; dietary sodium intake; physical activity; and systolic blood pressure. The unit of\\r\\n      randomization was the elementary school. Schools were recruited for participation and then\\r\\n      randomly assigned to the study groups. Twenty-four schools were recruited from each of the\\r\\n      four participating field centers for a total of 96 schools. In each center, ten of 24 schools\\r\\n      were assigned to the Control Group and 14 to the Intervention Group. Among the 14\\r\\n      intervention schools, seven were randomly assigned to the school-based intervention alone and\\r\\n      seven to the school-based and family component. Measures of behavioral outcome and process\\r\\n      variables were made during each grade from three through five. Physiological measurements\\r\\n      were made at baseline in grade three and at the end of grade five. Final measurements were\\r\\n      completed in May 1994. Close-out and final data analysis were conducted in the latter part of\\r\\n      1995 and in 1996. The major results paper was published in JAMA in March 1996. Ten major\\r\\n      mainstream papers were published in Preventive Medicine in 1996.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Tracking Study of CATCH III, beginning in December 1994, followed the cohort through\\r\\n      early adolescence in the sixth through eighth grades. The objectives were to measure the\\r\\n      effects of CATCH II intervention programs on subsequent smoking prevalence rates during the\\r\\n      end of the eighth grade and to observe the onset, development, and inter-correlation of\\r\\n      cardiovascular risk factors from early to middle adolescence in the cohort. There were no\\r\\n      CATCH interventions. Psychosocial measures, dietary fitness, and smoking data were collected\\r\\n      annually. The full panel of physiological measures and biochemical validation of smoking was\\r\\n      conducted during the last semester of eighth grade. CATCH III ended in November 1999. The\\r\\n      study was active through November 2000 under U01-HL-47098, the coordinating center.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In August of 1996, a homocysteine substudy was added to CATCH. The substudy used serum\\r\\n      samples collected in eighth graders in the spring of 1997 for analyses of homocysteine, folic\\r\\n      acid, vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, lipids, lipoproteins, blood pressure, weight and height. A\\r\\n      mail survey was conducted to collect data on the children's family history of cardiovascular\\r\\n      disease and vitamin supplementation. The results paper was published in JAMA in 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The CATCH-ON Study began in 1998. It's purpose was to assess the degree to which CATCH\\r\\n      intervention goals (reduction of fat and saturated fat in school meals, increase in physical\\r\\n      activity, no tobacco use, and implementation of the CATCH curriculum) were maintained or\\r\\n      institutionalized in the original 56 CATCH intervention schools and in 20 control schools.\\r\\n      CATCH-ON was Phase IV that ended March 31, 2001. To determine the influence of secular\\r\\n      trends, the outcome measures were also assessed in 12 newly recruited (unexposed) schools.\\r\\n      Measures of school climate, teacher and staff characteristics, school turbulence and school\\r\\n      facilities and resources were assessed to help explain the variation in the degree of\\r\\n      institutionalization in the CATCH intervention and control schools.\\r\\n    Acetaminophen34 Years22 YearsAll\",\n",

These facts have focused interest on estrogens as possible mediators of the\\r\\n      beneficial effects, and pointed to the need for further study of their relationship to\\r\\n      atherosclerosis risk factors.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Estimates from the Lipid Research Clinics Program indicate estrogen use in approximately one\\r\\n      third of postmenopausal women. Analysis of Lipid Research Clinics data confirmed that\\r\\n      administration of estrogens results in lower plasma low density lipoprotein levels and\\r\\n      elevated plasma high density lipoprotein levels. Thus, the ratio of high density\\r\\n      lipoprotein/low density lipoprotein levels is substantially increased. Given the inverse\\r\\n      relationship between high density lipoprotein levels and coronary heart disease risk, this\\r\\n      effect of estrogens on the plasma lipoproteins could be expected to further reduce coronary\\r\\n      heart disease risk in women.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Although the bulk of currently available evidence suggests benefit, some controversy\\r\\n      concerning the effects of postmenopausal estrogens on morbidity and mortality from coronary\\r\\n      heart disease persists. Analysis of the Lipid Research Clinics Follow-up Study population\\r\\n      indicated a potentially profound beneficial effect of postmenopausal estrogen use. Mortality\\r\\n      from all causes decreased considerably in postmenopausal estrogen users, and the effect was\\r\\n      most pronounced in hysterectomized and oophorectomized women. Similar results have been\\r\\n      observed for cardiovascular deaths. These benefits appeared to be mediated by the higher high\\r\\n      density lipoprotein levels associated with postmenopausal estrogen use. Framingham data are\\r\\n      the primary sources reporting possible detrimental effects of postmenopausal estrogen use on\\r\\n      cardiovascular morbidity; mortality from all cause and cardiovascular disease was not\\r\\n      reported to vary by use.\\r\\n\\r\\n      NHLBI convened a Trans-NIH Estrogen Working Group to make recommendations to NHLBI on the\\r\\n      feasibility of undertaking a clinical trial of the effects of postmenopausal estrogen use on\\r\\n      cardiovascular disease mortality. The Working Group identified a number of important research\\r\\n      questions which needed to be answered to elucidate the effects of postmenopausal estrogen use\\r\\n      on risk factors for cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. This initiative was the result\\r\\n      of the Working Group\\'s deliberations and recommendations.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      There were seven clinical centers and a coordinating center in this randomized, double-blind\\r\\n      clinical trial. The women were allocated to one of five treatment arms: placebo; conjugated\\r\\n      equine estrogen (CEE), 0.625 milligrams per day; conjugated equine estrogen, 0.625 milligrams\\r\\n      per day plus cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 10 milligrams per day for 12 days per\\r\\n      month; CEE, 0.625 milligrams per day plus consecutive MPA, 2.5 milligrams per day; CEE, 0.625\\r\\n      milligrams per day plus cyclic micronized progesterone (MP), 200 milligrams per day for 12\\r\\n      days a month. The four primary endpoints were chosen to represent four biological systems\\r\\n      related to the risk of cardiovascular disease and included high density lipoprotein\\r\\n      cholesterol (HDL-C), systolic blood pressure, serum insulin, and fibrinogen. Recruitment\\r\\n      began in October 1989 and ended in February 1991. Baseline data collected included blood\\r\\n      pressure, resting heart rate, weight, waist/hip ratios and endometrial biopsy. Laboratory\\r\\n      evaluations included lipid panel, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin and glucose,\\r\\n      bone density, fibrinogen, and in three clinics, additional hemostasis factors, renin\\r\\n      substrate, plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and oral post-heparin lipase activity. All\\r\\n      women underwent an endometrial aspiration biopsy at baseline and annually thereafter.\\r\\n      Additional biopsy specimens were obtained if there was noncyclic endometrial bleeding. All\\r\\n      women also had baseline and annual mammograms. Other data were collected on quality of life,\\r\\n      exercise, diet, alcohol use, and smoking. Participants were followed at three, six and twelve\\r\\n      months post-randomization, and at six month intervals thereafter for three years. Post-trial\\r\\n      analyses of existing data sets were funded for three years by the cooperative agreement\\r\\n      mechanism beginning August 1, 1994. A three-year safety follow-up funded through the contract\\r\\n      mechanism began in 1994.

       " 'cocaine abuse and attention deficit disorderthe purpose of this study is to evaluate cocaine abuse and attention deficit disorder\\n        Please contact site for information.\\r\\n      \\n      BACKGROUND:\\r\\n\\r\\n      PTCA is widely practiced as the procedure of choice for revascularization of the myocardium\\r\\n      in patients with single-vessel disease who are deemed to need intervention and is probably\\r\\n      more widely applied than surgery would be in the same group of patients. No study has shown\\r\\n      improved survival by intervention in such patients. The early natural history study by\\r\\n      Oberman showed survival experience of patients with single-vessel disease, including the\\r\\n      anterior descending, to resemble more closely patients with no coronary artery disease than\\r\\n      those with multivessel disease. Quality of life studies including the CASS randomized study,\\r\\n      which included 27 percent single-vessel disease patients, showed improved exercise tolerance\\r\\n      and less need for medication in patients who received PTCA For single-vessel disease. Balloon\\r\\n      angioplasty in single-vessel disease thus appears justified for the treatment of angina\\r\\n      pectoris.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In multivessel disease the CASS randomized trial has shown an improved survival at seven\\r\\n      years in the subset of patients with three-vessel disease and impaired ventricular function.\\r\\n      However, seven years may prove to be the point of widest separation between the medical and\\r\\n      surgical survival curves, based on the experience of the VA study which has presented results\\r\\n      to 11 years showing convergence of survival experience. Data from the Montreal Heart\\r\\n      Institute also indicate accelerated deterioration of venous grafts five to seven years after\\r\\n      surgery. The late failure of grafts is a potent argument for delaying CABG as long as\\r\\n      possible in the patients with multivessel disease. Should PTCA prove to be only a delaying\\r\\n      action in multivessel disease patients, a delay of several years until the first CABG\\r\\n      operation would confer an obvious advantage, even if repeat PTCA\\'s were required. Repeat CABG\\r\\n      may carry an increased risk and presumably the possibility of inadequate revascularization as\\r\\n      autologous graft material is used up.\\r\\n\\r\\n      As long as treatment for coronary artery disease is only palliative, management for the\\r\\n      individual patient requires a long-term (a lifetime) strategy, beginning with medical\\r\\n      management. PTCA could occupy an intermediate position in the time line of management of\\r\\n      multivessel disease patients if its relative efficiency in providing relief of ischemia and\\r\\n      ability to avoid or delay CABG were known. Most centers performing PTCA now have expanded the\\r\\n      indications for the procedure to patients with multivessel disease. However, its efficacy in\\r\\n      those patients has not been proven. Although data from the NHLBI PTCA Registry do include\\r\\n      patients with multivessel disease, most of those patients underwent only single PTCA\\r\\n      procedures even though they may have had stenoses in other vessels. Hence, a number of\\r\\n      questions must be raised concerning the usefulness of PTCA in patients with multivessel\\r\\n      disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Randomized, single-center. A total of 198 patients were randomized to the PTCA group and 194\\r\\n      to the CABG group. As initial treatment, one patient in the CABG group underwent angioplasty\\r\\n      and two patients in the PTCA group underwent surgery, but the groups were followed according\\r\\n      to an intention-to-treat analysis. Randomization was performed on the basis of four\\r\\n      angiographic strata. Data were collected at baseline, and the patients were contacted every\\r\\n      six months for follow-up information. Coronary arteriography and thallium stress scanning\\r\\n      were performed at one and three years. All patients were followed for the duration of the\\r\\n      trial. Repeat angiographic studies were performed in 87 percent of the eligible patients at\\r\\n      one year and in 76 percent at three years. Thallium scans were obtained in 88 percent of the\\r\\n      patients at one year and in 77 percent at three years. The primary endpoint was a composite\\r\\n      of death, Q-wave myocardial infarction within the previous three years, and detection of a\\r\\n      large ischemic defect on thallium scanning at three years. Secondary endpoints involved the\\r\\n      degree of revascularization at one and three years, ventricular function, exercise\\r\\n      performance, the need for subsequent revascularization procedures, the quality of life, and\\r\\n      costs. All patients admitted to Emory University Hospital and Crawford Long Memorial Hospital\\r\\n      for cardiac catheterization, whether entered into the study or not, were entered into a study\\r\\n      registry as were patients who were referred for a revascularization procedure but who had\\r\\n      their initial catheterization performed elsewhere. Recruitment ended in April 1990. The trial\\r\\n      has been extended through August 1997 to allow a minimum of eight years and a maximum of ten\\r\\n      years of followup for the registry patients as well as for the main cohort of randomized\\r\\n      patients. Telephone contact is established annually with study participants in order to\\r\\n      determine rates of survival, rehospitalization, repeat revascularization procedures, and\\r\\n      functional status.

Perhaps\\r\\n      one-half to two-thirds of these have sustained hypertension.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Despite the known etiologic relationship of hypertension to coronary heart disease,\\r\\n      large-scale randomized clinical trials in mild to moderate hypertension have failed to\\r\\n      demonstrate conclusively that antihypertensive drug treatment, largely based on thiazide-like\\r\\n      diuretics, reduces the occurrence of coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial\\r\\n      infarction. The pooled results of nine such trials, using primarily thiazide-like diuretics\\r\\n      and involving over 43,000 subjects, suggest a 9 percent benefit, with 95 percent confidence\\r\\n      limits consistent with a 19 percent benefit or 1 percent adverse outcome. This observed\\r\\n      treatment effect compares with a maximum predicted effect on coronary heart disease of\\r\\n      approximately 23 percent for an equivalent blood pressure difference, as derived from\\r\\n      epidemiologic data. In contrast, the observed beneficial effect on stroke in these trials, 36\\r\\n      percent, is almost exactly that which would be predicted from epidemiologic data. A more\\r\\n      recent overview of 14 trials in participants with all levels of hypertension estimated a\\r\\n      somewhat larger benefit of 14 percent. While this may be an over-estimate of benefit, these\\r\\n      overviews do not include the strongly positive results of the Systolic Hypertension in the\\r\\n      Elderly Program (SHEP), in which diuretic-based treatment reduced stroke incidence by 36\\r\\n      percent and major coronary heart disease events by 27 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the early 1980s, two new classes of antihypertensive agents, the calcium antagonists and\\r\\n      ACE inhibitors, were developed and licensed for use in chronic antihypertensive therapy.\\r\\n      These agents cost more than older agents such as diuretics and beta-blockers, and evidence\\r\\n      was limited that might justify their use despite the increased cost. The 1988 Joint National\\r\\n      Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommended\\r\\n      beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, ACE-inhibitors, and diuretics as equally acceptable\\r\\n      first-line therapy. All four classes of drugs have been found to control diastolic blood\\r\\n      pressure as single agents in 50 percent or more of patients with mild hypertension.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Of these drug classes, only beta-blockers have been compared directly to diuretics in\\r\\n      large-scale, long-term clinical trials in hypertension. Three such trials completed in Europe\\r\\n      in 1985-1986 showed approximate equivalence of effects on morbidity and mortality in\\r\\n      diuretic- and beta-blocker-based regimens. Pooled analysis of these trials yields a 6 percent\\r\\n      lower coronary heart disease mortality from beta-blockers. These data are in contrast to the\\r\\n      recent Medical Research Council (MRC) Trial in the Elderly, in which patients treated with a\\r\\n      thiazide diuretic had significantly lower rates of coronary heart disease compared to\\r\\n      beta-blocker treatment or placebo, both by about 45 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Circulating levels of cholesterol, specifically cholesterol associated with the low-density\\r\\n      lipoprotein (LDL) fraction, have been established as a major etiologic factor in coronary\\r\\n      heart disease in observational epidemiologic studies, in metabolic, pathologic, and genetic\\r\\n      studies in humans and selected animal models, and in randomized clinical trials. The clinical\\r\\n      trials that have demonstrated a reduction in coronary heart disease incidence from lowering\\r\\n      LDL-cholesterol levels have been conducted primarily in middle-aged men with\\r\\n      hypercholesterolemia or established coronary heart disease. Experimental evidence for the\\r\\n      efficacy of cholesterol lowering in older men is confined to the analysis of small subgroups\\r\\n      of clinical trials and is lacking for women of any age. The paucity of clinical trial data\\r\\n      led the National Cholesterol Education Program's Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and\\r\\n      Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults in their 1987 Guidelines to allow for\\r\\n      considerable physician judgement regarding the elderly.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Patients were recruited through office-based practices and hypertension clinics which were\\r\\n      reimbursed by the Clinical Trials Center on a per-patient basis.

The primary hypothesis of the antihypertensive trial was that the combined\\r\\n      incidence of fatal coronary heart disease and nonfatal myocardial infarction would be lower\\r\\n      in hypertensive patients randomized to amlodipine (a calcium antagonist), lisinopril (an\\r\\n      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor), or doxazosin (an alpha adrenergic blocker) as\\r\\n      compared to those randomized to chlorthalidone (a thiazide-like diuretic).

Further, there\\r\\n      remain questions regarding what causes an existing plaque that has been stable for a long\\r\\n      period of time to become occlusive or ulcerating and what may prevent it from doing so.\\r\\n      Prevention and treatment are almost certain to become multifaceted and more complex when\\r\\n      using several complementary interventions or preventive measures concomitantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Multifactorial prevention and treatment may be particularly useful in people with peripheral\\r\\n      arterial disease. PAD as manifested by intermittent claudication affects about 0.5 to 1.0\\r\\n      percent of individuals above age 35, with a twofold predominance in men. There is a\\r\\n      strikingly increased incidence with age in both sexes, particularly in those above age 50.\\r\\n      Mortality in patients with intermittent claudication has been shown to be six times higher\\r\\n      than in other people of similar age and gender. The excess in mortality is primarily due to a\\r\\n      ninefold increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths. Those who have asymptomatic but\\r\\n      measurable PAD (two to two-and-a-half times as many as have intermittent claudication), have\\r\\n      relative risks of about 3 and 4 for total and CVD mortality, respectively. Therefore,\\r\\n      interventions that prevent the development or progression of atherosclerotic disease or\\r\\n      reduce arterial thrombosis should reduce mortality and morbidity due to myocardial infarction\\r\\n      and stroke while favorably affecting the morbidity directly associated with PAD.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has included peripheral vascular disease\\r\\n      (PVD) in its guidelines as a risk factor in the Classification and Decision for Treatment\\r\\n      Algorithm. This means that patients who have PVD and elevated LDL-C and one other risk factor\\r\\n      such as male gender, family history, cigarette smoking, or hypertension, should have\\r\\n      appropriate dietary intervention followed by drug therapy as needed. Even with the guidelines\\r\\n      in place since the end of 1987, a survey of PVD patients referred to a major medical center\\r\\n      clinic found that very few patients were on lipid lowering therapy, either diet or drug. The\\r\\n      reason for the primary care community not modifying lipids in these high risk patients may be\\r\\n      related to lack of studies demonstrating benefit of lipid modification in those who have PVD.\\r\\n      It is anticipated that many patients with PAD will require treatment for elevated LDL-C. It\\r\\n      is not as clear whether interventions aimed at raising HDL-C will result in a slowing of\\r\\n      progression of atherosclerosis in this population.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Platelets have been shown to have a key role in the development of occlusive atherosclerosis\\r\\n      and thrombosis related to coronary heart disease. Inhibition of platelet function has been\\r\\n      postulated to slow progression of atherosclerosis; specifically, aspirin has been\\r\\n      demonstrated to reduce lipoprotein deposition in the arterial wall of nonhuman primates.

The secondary\\r\\n      endpoints were to determine the efficacy of the HDL-C raising arm to achieve an increase in\\r\\n      HDL-C in the treatment group while also obtaining equivalent reductions in LDL-C in the\\r\\n      treatment and control groups, to assess the dose-response of niacin on HDL-C raising, to\\r\\n      determine if the combination of low-dose warfarin plus aspirin versus aspirin alone had the\\r\\n      expected impact on the hemostatic system, to determine if combination antioxidant therapy\\r\\n      (vitamins E and C and beta carotene) led to changes in biomarkers for antioxidants, and to\\r\\n      determine the interaction of the lipid altering strategy with antioxidants for effects on\\r\\n      biomarkers for antioxidants.

       " 'risperidone treatment in dually diagnosed individualsthe purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of risperidone for cocaine dependence in individuals with schizophrenia schizoaffective illness\\n        Please contact site for information.\\r\\n      \\n      BACKGROUND:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Management strategies are urgently needed for the problem of sudden cardiac death, the most\\r\\n      common single, non-accidental cause of death in adults in North America. Many consider that\\r\\n      the problem of sudden cardiac death has reached epidemic proportions. Contemporary\\r\\n      prophylactic management of sudden cardiac death includes identification of high risk\\r\\n      populations, based on underlying structural heart disease, degree of left ventricular\\r\\n      dysfunction, and evidence of a ventricular arrhythmia propensity. Populations with the\\r\\n      highest sudden death cardiac risk, notably those patients resuscitated from spontaneous\\r\\n      episodes of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias, have been used as test populations for\\r\\n      the development of effective prophylactic approaches. However, in such populations, ethical\\r\\n      considerations have precluded the use of untreated control groups. Furthermore, such patients\\r\\n      comprise only a small proportion of the total patient population that could benefit from an\\r\\n      effective prophylactic strategy. The largest \\'at-risk\\' group are those patients with coronary\\r\\n      artery disease and depressed left ventricular function who have, but have not yet expressed,\\r\\n      a ventricular tachyarrhythmia propensity. The major advantages of a controlled trial of\\r\\n      prophylactic therapy in the latter population are evaluation of sudden death prophylaxis in\\r\\n      the larger \\'at-risk\\' population and the opportunity to do so with an untreated control group.\\r\\n      The \\'window of opportunity\\' for such comparisons has been closed in resuscitated patients for\\r\\n      some time and is in danger of closing in the larger population. The total absence of\\r\\n      controlled efficacy data for ICD use despite 30,000 implanted units of this expensive\\r\\n      technology argues strongly for the timely acquisition of controlled data in the larger\\r\\n      population before the therapy is embraced any further.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Randomized, non-blind. Patients were randomized during surgery for coronary artery bypass\\r\\n      graft to receive ICD or not, and followed and censored at 42 months at 35 centers. The\\r\\n      primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. The trial described morbidity of ICD treatment,\\r\\n      evaluated the effect of ICD therapy on quality of life, and compared health care costs of ICD\\r\\n      treatment to those in the control group. Anti-arrhythmic treatment of unsustained arrhythmia\\r\\n      was prohibited; anti-arrhythmic drug use, when indicated, was documented; and aspirin was\\r\\n      prescribed unless contraindications existed. Recruitment was extended through December 1995\\r\\n      in order to accrue 900 patients, instead of the original 800 projected. As of February 1996,\\r\\n      900 patients had been recruited. In April 1997, the DSMB recommended that the trial be\\r\\n      stopped because there was sufficient evidence to conclude that there was no difference\\r\\n      between the treatment and control groups.

Average\\r\\n      blood cholesterol levels will decline with the consumption of less saturated fat and\\r\\n      cholesterol than has been traditional in the United States. It is not clear, however, whether\\r\\n      reductions in total fat intake are necessary as well. More research also is needed to define\\r\\n      how best to provide a national food supply whose composition will enhance efforts to reduce\\r\\n      coronary heart disease risk. Fatty acid investigations are especially critical, because this\\r\\n      is an area in which the food industry has greater latitude in reformulating products\\r\\n      according to current scientific evidence, dietary recommendations, and customer demand.\\r\\n      Stearic acid, for example, may be suitable as a replacement for 'hard' fatty acids because it\\r\\n      has relatively little effect on total blood cholesterol levels, but it may be rendered less\\r\\n      suitable for this purpose if it accelerates the tendency of blood to clot. Similarly,\\r\\n      hydrogenated vegetable oils are used as substitutes for saturated animal fats, but they\\r\\n      contain trans-fatty acids that may raise low-density lipoprotein levels as do saturated fatty\\r\\n      acids. In general, the mechanisms by which diet influences the eventual development of\\r\\n      atherosclerosis through alterations in lipid and lipoprotein levels and metabolism, and\\r\\n      through other factors such as hemostasis, still are not fully understood.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Human clinical nutrition studies, when feasible, are among the best research approaches for\\r\\n      addressing the links between diet and atherosclerosis. Moreover, because of their great\\r\\n      relevance to everyday life, their findings are quickly publicized. Often, however, such\\r\\n      studies do not yield consistent or reproducible results. The resulting transmission of mixed\\r\\n      messages to the scientific and lay communities seriously undermines both the credibility of\\r\\n      nutrition research and the public's confidence in the possibility of obtaining reliable and\\r\\n      practical advice on how to modify diet. Oat bran, with its rise and fall in the scientific\\r\\n      and popular press as well as in the marketplace, is a good example of this phenomenon.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The lack of consistency among designs of clinical nutrition studies seeking to answer the\\r\\n      same scientific question (for example, the influence of dietary fiber on serum cholesterol\\r\\n      levels) means that their results cannot be readily compared. Some study designs are flawed,\\r\\n      lacking adequate hypotheses and control groups. In addition, compliance in dietary studies is\\r\\n      frequently less than ideal. Studies that allow participants to select and prepare their own\\r\\n      food, even when adhering to an 'experimental' diet, frequently do not provide reliable\\r\\n      results. Only in tightly controlled clinical settings, in which the participants receive all\\r\\n      food from the experimental kitchen and are known to consume it, can the influence of poor\\r\\n      compliance be minimized.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A further complication is that the actual composition of study diets may not be as intended\\r\\n      due to natural variations in food sources and the vagaries of food composition databases.\\r\\n      Such discrepancies can be sufficient to alter the results of the study and lead to false\\r\\n      conclusions, yet research budgets seldom allow for the high cost of food composition\\r\\n      analyses.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The typical small size of clinical nutrition studies has far-reaching effects. Because these\\r\\n      studies are expensive and require great commitments of labor and space, it generally is very\\r\\n      difficult for a single investigator funded by a traditional research grant to enroll, feed,\\r\\n      and study more than 20 to 25 participants at one time. This imposes constraints on duration,\\r\\n      design, and statistical power; consequently, many human nutrition studies lack sufficient\\r\\n      power to detect biologically meaningful differences between groups or treatments. To avoid\\r\\n      outside sources of variability that would further reduce study power, investigators usually\\r\\n      make efforts to assemble a 'homogeneous' study population and minimize the number of factors\\r\\n      that might impinge on the experimental design; thus, studies are most often conducted in\\r\\n      young Caucasian males with average or even low plasma cholesterol levels. Not much is known,\\r\\n      therefore, about how response to diet is affected by sex, age, race, co-morbid conditions\\r\\n      (such as obesity), lipoprotein phenotype and other factors that would make the results more\\r\\n      generalizable to the population at large. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the\\r\\n      so-called 'hypo-responder' phenomenon, wherein individuals are presumed to be insensitive to\\r\\n      the effects of diet on plasma lipid levels, cannot be elucidated unless individuals with a\\r\\n      wide range of response are studied in adequate numbers.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Arteriosclerosis, Hypertension, and Lipid Metabolism Advisory Committee recommended the\\r\\n      development of the initiative at their February 1991 meeting. The National Heart, Lung, and\\r\\n      Blood Advisory Council approved the concept at its September 1991 meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The first protocol, conducted in 1993-1994, compared the effects of three diets varying in\\r\\n      total fat (37 percent, 30 percent, and 26 percent) and saturated fat (16 percent, 9 percent,\\r\\n      and 5 percent) on plasma lipoprotein and thrombogenic activity in 103 normal adults. Subjects\\r\\n      consumed the three diets for eight weeks each. Ten meals per week were consumed on-site and\\r\\n      all other food was packed for take-home use.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The second protocol, conducted in 1994-1995, examined lipoprotein levels and hemostatic\\r\\n      parameters in 86 subjects having low high density lipoprotein levels and/or high triglyceride\\r\\n      levels and/or high insulin levels and consuming for seven weeks each one of three diets: a\\r\\n      typical American diet, a high monounsaturated fat diet, or a high carbohydrate diet.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DELTA also expended considerable effort in the field of food composition analysis.

At the time of discharge from the hospital\\r\\n      following a documented myocardial infarction, patients were randomized to treatment and\\r\\n      control groups. The control group received usual care from their physicians. In addition to\\r\\n      usual care, treatment patients were phoned monthly and responded to a standardized index of\\r\\n      psychological symptoms of stress. Those with high stress levels received home nursing visits\\r\\n      to reduce their stress. Patients in both groups took part in three interviews: in the\\r\\n      hospital, at three months, and at one year post-discharge. Interviews assessed depression,\\r\\n      anxiety, anger, self-perceived stress, social support, medication compliance, and cardiac\\r\\n      risk factors. Salivary cortisol, a physiological indicator of stress, was assessed on the\\r\\n      evening following each interview. Indicators of residual myocardial infarction, ischemia, and\\r\\n      arrhythmias were obtained from hospital charts. Outcome data were obtained from hospital\\r\\n      charts, death certificates, and Quebec Medicare data and were blindly classified by study\\r\\n      cardiologists.\\r\\n    Sertraline65 Years18 YearsAll',\n",

The exact proportion of cardiac deaths that\\r\\n      are classified as being sudden varies depending on the population, the underlying disease,\\r\\n      and the definition of sudden death. Various estimates suggest that about 500,000 sudden\\r\\n      cardiac deaths occur annually in the United States alone. The majority of sudden cardiac\\r\\n      deaths are thought to be due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) or tachycardia (VT).\\r\\n\\r\\n      The commonest approach to preventing sudden cardiac death has been by the use of drugs that\\r\\n      suppress ventricular ectopy. The rational for this approach is based upon an association\\r\\n      between the presence or frequency of ventricular arrhythmia and subsequent mortality in\\r\\n      several studies. None of the randomized controlled studies of numerous 'classical'\\r\\n      antiarrhythmic agents (other than beta-blockers, which have only a modest effect on\\r\\n      arrhythmia suppression) have demonstrated a reduction in sudden or non-sudden cardiac\\r\\n      mortality. Indeed, in the recent Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), two class Ic\\r\\n      anti-arrhythmic agents demonstrated a 2.5 fold increase in the risk of sudden and non-sudden\\r\\n      cardiac deaths despite excellent suppression of ventricular arrhythmia.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Given the disappointing results of most pharmacologic approaches to preventing sudden death,\\r\\n      many investigators have turned to non-pharmacologic approaches such as surgery (endocardial\\r\\n      resection, stellate ganglionectomy) or the implantation of devices that recognize VT or VF\\r\\n      and deliver a shock. The greatest interest has been generated by work on the implantable\\r\\n      cardiac defibrillator.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The study was reviewed by an ad hoc working group, the Clinical Applications and Prevention\\r\\n      Advisory Committee, and several members of the Cardiology Advisory Committee prior to review\\r\\n      and approval by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council in September 1991. The\\r\\n      Request for Proposals was released in February 1992.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      At approximately 28 clinical sites, patients with ventricular tachycardia or ventricular\\r\\n      fibrillation were screened. Those with ventricular fibrillation or serious ventricular\\r\\n      tachycardia were entered into a registry for long-term mortality follow-up using the National\\r\\n      Death Index. Patients with the prospect of long-term benefit from an ICD and/or\\r\\n      antiarrhythmic drug therapy and without exclusions to an ICD or to amiodarone and without a\\r\\n      transient or correctible cause of the index event were entered into the trial.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Patients meeting the criteria were randomized to treatment with an ICD or treatment with\\r\\n      antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Allocation was stratified by clinical site and index arrhythmia,\\r\\n      either ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Patients assigned to the\\r\\n      antiarrhythmic drug therapy and without contraindications to sotalol underwent\\r\\n      subrandomization to either empiric amiodarone or sotalol, the latter treatment guided by\\r\\n      either ambulatory monitoring or electrophysiologic testing. Patients who, after\\r\\n      subrandomization, had low levels (less than 30 beats per hour) of ventricular ectopic beats\\r\\n      and no inducible ventricular arrhythmias at electrophysiologic study were not treated with\\r\\n      sotalol and instead received empiric amiodarone. The AVID protocol allowed usual clinical\\r\\n      practice but restricted interventions to state-of-the art ICD devices and first-line\\r\\n      antiarrhythmic agents to amiodarone and sotalol. Patients who could not take amiodarone were\\r\\n      not included in the trial. The protocol encouraged the use of concurrent drugs such as\\r\\n      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and beta-blockers when appropriate,\\r\\n      administered before randomization and maintained throughout the study. The primary endpoint\\r\\n      was total mortality. Secondary endpoints were cost of health care and quality of life.\\r\\n      Nonlethal events such as ICD shock, sustained arrhythmia, or syncope were tabulated.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Patients were followed every three months for assessment of secondary endpoints, to record\\r\\n      therapies delivered by the ICD and potential adverse effects of the ICD, and to assess\\r\\n      compliance and potential adverse symptoms in patients treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. A\\r\\n      12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained every six months, and appropriate laboratory and\\r\\n      pulmonary tests were performed at six and eighteen months on patients receiving amiodarone.\\r\\n      The average follow-up was expected to be 2.6 years. Analysis was done by intention-to-treat.\\r\\n      The outcome of primary interest in the subrandomization between sotalol and amiodarone was\\r\\n      the time to withdrawal from assigned therapy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      After a review of the data by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, the AVID study was\\r\\n      stopped early on April 7, 1997 because of the findings that after one year, patients in the\\r\\n      defibrillator group experienced a nearly 38 percent reduction in deaths compared to the group\\r\\n      of patients taking an antiarrhythmic drug.

A substantial body of evidence from both population and\\r\\n      laboratory studies indicates that a number of dietary and lifestyle factors are associated\\r\\n      with the chronic and progressive increase in blood pressure with age, commonly observed in\\r\\n      populations of industrialized countries. There are also an increasing number of reports of\\r\\n      important reductions in blood pressure in persons with hypertension following treatment with\\r\\n      a number of different non-pharmacological interventions. These observations have led to\\r\\n      interest in the possibility of the primary prevention of hypertension through\\r\\n      non-pharmacological intervention on factors related to the development of high blood\\r\\n      pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In 1979, the main results of the NHLBI-supported Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program\\r\\n      (HDFP), then the largest of the randomized clinical trials of antihypertensive drug\\r\\n      treatment, were reported. This trial compared the effects of intensive systematic\\r\\n      Stepped-Care drug treatment with Referred-Care in the community. These results confirmed\\r\\n      findings of earlier and subsequently reported placebo-controlled trials that effective\\r\\n      blood-pressure lowering in hypertensive individuals reduces the occurrence of stroke,\\r\\n      congestive heart failure, and other complications of hypertension, and for the first time\\r\\n      demonstrated a significant reduction of total mortality. The implications of the findings\\r\\n      regarding recommendations for long-term drug treatment for tens of millions of Americans led\\r\\n      several groups of investigators to consider alternative approaches to the control of\\r\\n      hypertension. To the concerns of these clinicians about drug-related symptoms and economic\\r\\n      costs were added additional questions regarding the safety of common antihypertensive agents\\r\\n      in some hypertensive subgroups, based on the results of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention\\r\\n      Trial and on other evidence.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A number of small to moderate-sized randomized clinical trials of non-pharmacologic\\r\\n      intervention in hypertension have been initiated during the past 5 years with NHLBI support.\\r\\n      The Hypertension Prevention Trial (HPT) was the largest program studying the effectiveness of\\r\\n      intervening in a non-hypertensive population. The HPT was a feasibility study to establish\\r\\n      the ability to enroll in sufficient numbers men and women with diastolic blood pressure of\\r\\n      78-89 mm Hg; to determine if dietary intervention alone could achieve sustained weight\\r\\n      reduction, and/or a decrease in sodium intake, or an increase in potassium intake along with\\r\\n      sodium reduction in these subjects; and to study the effects of the interventions on blood\\r\\n      pressure. If feasibility were demonstrated, the plan was to conduct a full-scale trial with\\r\\n      incidence of frank hypertension as the outcome measure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The HPT achieved its feasibility goals regarding recruitment of participants and weight\\r\\n      reduction, but not for dietary sodium reduction and potassium increase. Some of the other\\r\\n      dietary trials among non-hypertensive subjects have also achieved relatively small sodium\\r\\n      changes (20-25 percent); a few have produced much larger changes, but only with short-term\\r\\n      follow-up. Other experience has also shown that it is difficult to increase potassium intake\\r\\n      by dietary means alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The importance of further work in this area has meanwhile been reinforced by conclusions of\\r\\n      several expert groups convened by NHLBI. These have included the participants in the 1984 NIH\\r\\n      Workshop on Nutrition and Hypertension and the 1984 Joint National Committee on Detection,\\r\\n      Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, whose report addressed in some detail\\r\\n      non-pharmacologic intervention and primary prevention.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Phase I was a pilot study to test the feasibility of providing and obtaining compliance with\\r\\n      selected nutritional-behavioral, non-pharmacologic interventions and to measure the\\r\\n      short-term effectiveness of the interventions on reducing or preventing an increase in\\r\\n      diastolic blood pressure.

Of these, the post-myocardial infarction\\r\\n      population constitutes a large proportion. About 8 to 15 percent of patients who recover from\\r\\n      an acute myocardial infarction die in the subsequent year. Half of these deaths are usually\\r\\n      sudden, presumably due to arrhythmia. Advanced age, poor ventricular function, and presence\\r\\n      of ventricular arrhythmias can identify post-MI patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death\\r\\n      and all-cause mortality.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A number of clinical trials have evaluated whether acute or chronic anti-arrhythmic drug\\r\\n      therapy can reduce mortality in post-MI patients. Of these, only the use of acute intravenous\\r\\n      and long-term beta-blockers, independently and in combination, had been shown to reduce\\r\\n      mortality. However, beta-blockers have many actions in addition to being anti-arrhythmic\\r\\n      agents and it is possible that these other effects may have been particularly important in\\r\\n      prolonging life.\\r\\n\\r\\n      None of the clinical trials of other antiarrhythmic drugs had shown significant benefits from\\r\\n      treatment, and a number had even failed to show a positive trend. It was certainly possible\\r\\n      that treatment of ventricular premature depolarizations, in itself, did not lead to a\\r\\n      reduction in mortality, or even sudden death. The studies that had been done, however, had\\r\\n      not adequately addressed the issue. Most of the studies were small and did not select\\r\\n      patients on the basis of frequent ectopic beats. Moreover, appropriate drugs in optimal doses\\r\\n      may not have been used, and adverse effects may well have outweighed any potential benefit.\\r\\n      Poor compliance, perhaps due to adverse effects, may also have limited the opportunity for a\\r\\n      beneficial outcome.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In an effort to address some of these points, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\r\\n      initiated the Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study in 1982. The objectives were to assess: whether\\r\\n      post-MI patients with documented ventricular arrhythmia could be identified and enrolled into\\r\\n      a double-blind clinical trial; whether one or more drugs could be found to effectively and\\r\\n      safely reduce ventricular premature depolarizations over a one-year period; whether\\r\\n      dose-adjustment could be carried out, using ambulatory ECG's; and whether good patient\\r\\n      compliance could be maintained. The Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study, which enrolled 500\\r\\n      patients, evaluated four active drugs (encainide, ethmozine, flecainide, imipramine) against\\r\\n      placebo. The study was too small to determine whether any of these drugs had an effect on\\r\\n      mortality or major morbidity. The study was completed in July 1986.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The pilot study demonstrated that patient recruitment was feasible, that dose-adjustment\\r\\n      could be accomplished, and that good compliance to the protocol could be achieved. Because of\\r\\n      the encouraging results of the pilot study, the NHLBI conducted a full-scale trial.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Randomized, double-blind. Enrollment began in June 1987 when twenty-seven clinical centers\\r\\n      began to randomize 4,400 post-myocardial infarction patients to placebo or treatment with\\r\\n      encainide, flecainide, or moricizine. Prior to actual randomization, there was an open-label\\r\\n      titration period to identify patients who responded to treatment. A total of 1,727 patients\\r\\n      who responded were randomized: 1,455 to encainide, flecainide, or placebo, and 272 to\\r\\n      moricizine or placebo. In April 1989, encainide and flecainide were discontinued because of\\r\\n      increased total mortality and sudden arrhythmic death. CAST continued to compare moricizine\\r\\n      to placebo in 1,300 patients for 18 months until August 1991 when the moricizine portion of\\r\\n      the trial was stopped early because of excess deaths.

The value of\\r\\n      anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation without rheumatic heart disease\\r\\n      had not been established. Several studies strongly suggested that although the risk of stroke\\r\\n      in patients with atrial fibrillation was greatest in the presence of valvular disease, the\\r\\n      risk of stroke in the absence of valvular disease was also much greater in patients with\\r\\n      atrial fibrillation than those without this arrhythmia. What was lacking was a detailed\\r\\n      controlled study assessing the degree of reduction in stroke risk by anticoagulation of\\r\\n      fibrillating patients without valvular disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The second question asked was whether the added potential morbidity or mortality associated\\r\\n      with long-term anticoagulation therapy justified its use in the prophylactic treatment of\\r\\n      neurologically asymptomatic patients with atrial fibrillation, even if it did reduce stroke\\r\\n      risk.

Using a rigorous ECG monitoring protocol in\\r\\n      patients, a less than five percent per year incidence of sudden death had been reported.\\r\\n      Several investigators reported that the results of electropharmacologic testing were\\r\\n      predictive of clinical response. One of the largest studies, by Mason and Winkle, reported\\r\\n      that, in 51 patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia who were treated with drugs\\r\\n      predicted to be effective based on the results of electropharmacologic testing, ventricular\\r\\n      tachycardia did not recur in 68 percent at 18 months of follow-up. In contrast, ventricular\\r\\n      tachycardia did not recur in only 11 percent of patients treated with drugs predicted to be\\r\\n      ineffective.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Two prior studies had compared, in a non-randomized fashion, the predictive accuracy of EPS\\r\\n      and HM in treating patients with ventricular tachycardia/ ventricular fibrillation. A\\r\\n      retrospective analysis of 44 patients with ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation\\r\\n      who underwent both HM and EPS was performed in which the elimination of ventricular\\r\\n      tachycardia on the HM and the suppression of ventricular tachycardia induced during\\r\\n      programmed stimulation was the therapeutic goal. The positive and negative predictive value\\r\\n      of EPS was found to be 88 percent and 94 percent, respectively. The corresponding values for\\r\\n      ECG monitoring were found to be 70 percent and 50 percent, respectively. It was concluded\\r\\n      that EPS provided a higher degree of accuracy than HM in predicting the long-term clinical\\r\\n      response to drug therapy, over a mean follow-up of 18 months. However, in this study the\\r\\n      criterion for judging efficacy by HM was a liberal one and involved only the elimination of\\r\\n      ventricular tachycardia.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A second study examined the results of HM in 19 patients with ventricular tachycardia who\\r\\n      were treated based on EPS. Among eight patients, in whom inducible ventricular tachycardia\\r\\n      was suppressed during electrophysiologic testing, six had no change or worsening of premature\\r\\n      ventricular contractions on the HM. These patients had a benign follow-up despite the\\r\\n      continued presence of frequent or complex ventricular ectopy. It was concluded that EPS was\\r\\n      superior to HM in predicting successful drug therapy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Existing data suggested that both electrophysiologic testing and Holter monitoring might be\\r\\n      effective techniques for determining effective drug therapy for ventricular\\r\\n      tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation.

Since the prevalence of\\r\\n      congestive heart failure is known to increase with age, improvements in the average life\\r\\n      expectancy would be expected to increase the magnitude of the problem over the next few\\r\\n      decades. While advances in the treatment of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and\\r\\n      surgical treatment of congenital and valvular heart disease have prolonged survival, many of\\r\\n      these patients ultimately develop heart failure in later life.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The therapy of congestive heart failure has undergone rapid change. Until the early 1970s,\\r\\n      the mainstay of therapy for the patient with acute and chronic congestive heart failure was\\r\\n      digitalis and diuretics. The use of digitalis in patients with heart failure secondary to\\r\\n      ischemic heart disease and in those with severe left ventricular failure of either\\r\\n      nonischemic or ischemic origin was, however, controversial.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Controversy over the acute and long-term effects of digitalis led to the introduction of a\\r\\n      variety of alternative and supplemental therapeutic approaches for the patient with heart\\r\\n      failure. In the mid 1980s, a wide spectrum of vasodilators was available. New, at that time,\\r\\n      inotropic agents, also found applications as alternatives or supplements to digitalis\\r\\n      administration. Although all of these drugs had been shown to be of some benefit in the\\r\\n      management of patients with chronic heart failure, there was inadequate information as to the\\r\\n      long-term hemodynamic effects of some of these agents and practically no information\\r\\n      regarding their effect on survival.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The recognition that patients with congestive heart failure often have elevated peripheral\\r\\n      vascular resistance led to the introduction of vasodilator therapy. Of the vasodilators, the\\r\\n      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appeared to be the most promising because they\\r\\n      had been shown to counteract some of the major adverse hormonal and vasoconstrictor\\r\\n      mechanisms, relieve symptoms, diminish cardiac dilatation after myocardial infarction, and\\r\\n      improve exercise capacity and ejection fraction.\\r\\n\\r\\n      SOLVD was initiated in 1986 primarily to evaluate the effects of enalapril, an\\r\\n      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Two considerations influenced the design of\\r\\n      SOLVD: it was possible that drug treatment given to patients who already had manifest\\r\\n      congestive heart failure might not be as beneficial as initiating treatment in asymptomatic\\r\\n      left ventricular dysfunction patients; early treatment of such asymptomatic patients might be\\r\\n      less beneficial, as the patient might not have measurable activation of the renin-angiotensin\\r\\n      axis.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Request for Proposals was released in August 1984 with the first awards made in July\\r\\n      1985. A second Request for Proposals for additional clinical centers was released in March\\r\\n      1985.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Both trials were randomized and double-blind. Prior to randomization, all patients received\\r\\n      enalapril, and placebo for two weeks to enable early detection of non-compliant patients,\\r\\n      those unable to tolerate the drug, and those with early side-effects.

In a\\r\\n      previous study the investigators did not find a hypotensive effect of another polyunsaturated\\r\\n      fatty acid, linoleic acid. In addition, findings of lower blood pressures in vegetarians and\\r\\n      results obtained from a study in which vegetarian diets were fed to normotensives led to the\\r\\n      conclusion that dietary factors other then linoleic acid were responsible for the possible\\r\\n      hypotensive effect of vegetarian diets.

Intracoronary thrombolysis was receiving widespread clinical applications but\\r\\n      had many limitations. The intracoronary route took 90-120 minutes longer to administer than\\r\\n      the intravenous route.

One reason is that it is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, most notably\\r\\n      hypertension. For example, in the Framingham study it was found that relative body weight,\\r\\n      weight change during observation, and skin fold thickness were related to existing blood\\r\\n      pressure levels and to the subsequent rate of development of hypertension. Additionally, for\\r\\n      previously normotensive individuals, the risk of developing hypertension was proportional to\\r\\n      the degree of overweight. Obesity is also a major risk factor for type II diabetes mellitus.\\r\\n      On the other hand, some overweight individuals are physically healthy but suffer from the\\r\\n      psychosocial consequences of their condition so that losing weight would be desirable for\\r\\n      them as well as for individuals more at risk for physical illness.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Like essential hypertension, obesity is not only a chronic condition for many individuals but\\r\\n      it is also a heterogeneous condition with many underlying causes and interacting factors. It\\r\\n      is generally difficult to treat because it is a chronic problem, success comes slowly, and\\r\\n      physicians in practice generally understand the condition rather poorly and do not manage it\\r\\n      well. Results from studies of caloric restriction, behavior modification and medication have\\r\\n      often been disappointing both to the subjects and their physicians. In practice, dropout\\r\\n      rates from exercise programs, as well as various dietary self-help programs have been\\r\\n      relatively high.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Similarly, in clinical trials dropout rates have often been quite high. Compounding the\\r\\n      problem of weight management has been a rather universal negative bias on the part of\\r\\n      physicians to prescribing anorexiant medications. It was previously generally held that these\\r\\n      agents were either only effective in the short term or not at all. Additionally, there has\\r\\n      always been concern about the potential adverse effects of anorexiants as well as their\\r\\n      potential for abuse. Physicians who used appetite suppressants often prescribed them for only\\r\\n      four to six weeks which was inappropriate in the management of a chronic condition.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In several relatively short term clinical trials (e.g., 16 weeks), it has been shown that\\r\\n      appetite control medications such as fenfluramine and phentermine were more effective than\\r\\n      placebo in inducing weight loss. It has been less clear from the trials performed heretofore\\r\\n      how effective anorectic medications were when used as an adjunct to behavior modification and\\r\\n      diet. This aspect was addressed in the first two years of the clinical trial under\\r\\n      consideration here.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A second controversial issue concerned the duration of efficacy of anorexiant agents.\\r\\n      Originally it was felt that tolerance developed, hence the recommendations for short courses\\r\\n      of treatment.

The potential for reduction in mortality by identification and\\r\\n      administration of drugs capable of safely suppressing ventricular arrhythmias was tremendous.\\r\\n      In 1982, there was incomplete knowledge regarding which types of ventricular arrhythmias\\r\\n      responded to various kinds of drugs. A pilot study of antiarrhythmic agents helped clarify\\r\\n      this issue.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Numerous antiarrhythmic agents with differing pharmacologic properties and side effects had\\r\\n      been shown to suppress ventricular arrhythmias.

There had been several published reports of large (at least l00 patients),\\r\\n      long-term clinical trials of antiarrhythmic agents in post-MI patients. None of these had\\r\\n      yielded statistically significant results using mortality as the response variable. This\\r\\n      might have been due to incorrect drug selection, inadequate sample size, inappropriate choice\\r\\n      of patients, or the lack of impact of arrhythmia treatment on mortality.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Due to incomplete knowledge as to which drug(s) and combinations of drugs were most\\r\\n      effective, it was considered to be premature to undertake a full scale trial in 1981-1982.\\r\\n      However, the public health problem was of sufficient magnitude to warrant a pilot study to\\r\\n      learn more about the efficacy and safety of various antiarrhythmic drugs singly or in\\r\\n      combination.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The protocol planning phase began in October l982.

Studies have confirmed that myocardial infarction is related\\r\\n      to an occlusive coronary thrombus in up to 80 percent of patients. First and\\r\\n      second-generation thrombolytic agents (including streptokinase and rt-PA) have been\\r\\n      successfully used to restore myocardial blood flow where thrombus has occluded an\\r\\n      infarct-related coronary artery. However, further clinical investigation was necessary to\\r\\n      determine the most suitable thrombolytic agent dose and method of administration, the risk of\\r\\n      subsequent reocclusion, restenosis, and/or myocardial infarction, the need for additional\\r\\n      therapies, and the likelihood of benefit or hemorrhagic complications.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In 1983 the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the TIMI Study Group. The\\r\\n      group consisted of 13 clinical centers (later expanded to 24), a Radiographic Core\\r\\n      Laboratory, Radionuclide Core Laboratory, and a Data Coordinating Center.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The TIMI trial was conducted in two stages. In Phase I or TIMI I, eligible patients were\\r\\n      randomized to receive either 80 mg of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA)\\r\\n      or 1.5 million units of streptokinase intravenously to determine relative safety and\\r\\n      efficacy. Following randomization, patients found to have angiographically documented\\r\\n      stenosis greater than 50 percent in the infarct-related artery received thrombolytic therapy\\r\\n      in a double-blind fashion, full anticoagulation, and conventional care. Patients subsequently\\r\\n      underwent repeat catheterization, radionuclide ventriculogram, and pre-discharge, six-week\\r\\n      and six-month cardiovascular examination.\\r\\n\\r\\n      TIMI I was stopped in February 1985 because of statistically significant differences in\\r\\n      coronary reperfusion rates in the treatment groups; rt-PA was found to be the superior\\r\\n      thrombolytic agent. Following TIMI Phase I, the manufacturer of rt-PA changed to a\\r\\n      large-scale production method for rt-PA, and the new product was found to have thrombolytic\\r\\n      activity and specificity in vitro and in experimental animals comparable to the product\\r\\n      manufactured by the old method. However, the TIMI investigators concluded that clinical\\r\\n      evaluation would be necessary prior to initiation of TIMI Phase II.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Thus, TIMI Open Label Phase studies were initiated in 1985, with the aim of establishing the\\r\\n      safety and efficacy of the \\'new\\' intravenous rt-PA. As in Phase I, the endpoint was lysis of\\r\\n      coronary thrombus within 90 minutes of the initiation of treatment in patients with\\r\\n      documented total occlusion of the infarct-related coronary artery. Additional goals of the\\r\\n      study were to determine reocclusion rates of infarct-related arteries at 18-48 hours, as well\\r\\n      as to determine the efficacy of PTCA to maintain perfusion in infarct-related arteries and\\r\\n      prevention of recurrent myocardial infarction. The TIMI Open Label Phase studies determined\\r\\n      that optimal coronary recanalization and maintenance of reperfusion occurred with 150 mg of\\r\\n      \\'new\\' rt-PA infused over six hours. However, subsequent hemorrhagic complications observed\\r\\n      with 150 mg rt-PA necessitated a change in the dose of rt-PA to 100 mg.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In TIMI II, patient entry began in April 1986 and ended in June 1988 with enrollment of 3,534\\r\\n      patients. Patients were treated with intravenous rt-PA within four hours of the onset of\\r\\n      chest pain thought to be caused by myocardial infarction and randomly assigned to an invasive\\r\\n      strategy or a conservative strategy. The primary endpoint was survival free of recurrent\\r\\n      myocardial infarction at six weeks and one year of follow-up. There were 1,681 patients\\r\\n      assigned to the delayed invasive strategy in which catheterization was performed between 18\\r\\n      and 48 hours after rt-PA therapy. If catheterization showed a greater than 60 percent\\r\\n      subtotal stenosis of the infarct-related artery that was considered to be technically\\r\\n      approachable, angioplasty was attempted. Angioplasty was performed in 60.5 percent of the\\r\\n      1,500 patients who underwent catheterization in the invasive strategy group. The remaining\\r\\n      39.5 percent or 593 patients did not have angioplasty performed.

Periodic blood\\r\\n      transfusions are associated with significant risks of iron overload and other complications\\r\\n      and must be accompanied by parenteral iron chelation therapy. However, this has become a\\r\\n      standard of care for prevention of recurrent stroke in SS children. Thus, a randomized trial\\r\\n      of blood transfusion for secondary prevention would not be feasible because it would be\\r\\n      considered unethical. Based on various studies, the recurrence rate is reduced from 46 to 67\\r\\n      percent to approximately 7 percent on transfusion therapy. Because most stroke patients are\\r\\n      left with some neurological deficit, and face a lifetime of disability, primary prevention\\r\\n      would have a significant impact on the management of patients. However, because of\\r\\n      complications of blood transfusions, the hypothesis should be proven by a randomized clinical\\r\\n      trial.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A primary prevention trial had not been possible because an acceptable means of detecting\\r\\n      those children at risk of stroke was not available.

The main\\r\\n      risk group of the past, homosexual males, has reduced numbers of new infections because of\\r\\n      education and prevention. Other groups, including intravenous drug abusers, disadvantaged\\r\\n      urban socioeconomic classes and adolescents, continue to be infected and to transmit HIV by\\r\\n      needle sharing and/or unprotected heterosexual activity. Many of these newly infected\\r\\n      individuals are women of child-bearing age. These women in turn infect their children. The\\r\\n      Centers for Disease Control estimates that there will be 2,000 infected infants born to 6,000\\r\\n      HIV-positive mothers annually in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Over the past few years, several studies have identified the risk of maternal-fetal\\r\\n      transmission of HIV by seropositive mothers. The risk is close to 30 percent. However, for\\r\\n      reasons not yet understood, the risk appears to be higher in Africa, approaching 40 percent,\\r\\n      and lower in Europe, approaching 16 percent. Factors influencing maternal-fetal transmission\\r\\n      of HIV are not well defined but may include the clinical state of the mother, plasma p24\\r\\n      antigen positivity of the mother, viral load, prior pregnancy associated with maternal-fetal\\r\\n      HIV transmission, absence of maternal epitope specific and/or high affinity gp120 antibodies,\\r\\n      or prematurity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The results of a Phase III, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled\\r\\n      clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerance of zidovudine for the\\r\\n      prevention of HIV transmission from infected pregnant women to their infants (ACTG protocol\\r\\n      076) provided for the first time proof of the concept that a preventive intervention can\\r\\n      reduce vertical HIV transmission (47). Based on analysis of data for 364 evaluable births,\\r\\n      zidovudine (ZDV or AZT) treatment according to the regimen employed in ACTG 076 appeared to\\r\\n      reduce the risk of HIV transmission by two thirds, from 25.5 percent to 8.3 percent. Eligible\\r\\n      subjects were HIV-infected pregnant women who had received no antiretroviral therapy during\\r\\n      their current pregnancy, who had no maternal clinical indications for antiretroviral therapy,\\r\\n      and who had CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts above 200 per microliter at study entry.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Efficacy of ZDV for reduction of vertical HIV transmission in women with advanced HIV disease\\r\\n      who are already receiving antiretroviral treatment according to current clinical indications\\r\\n      for their own health, or with CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts of 200 per microliter or below, or\\r\\n      both was not evaluated in ACTG 076.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Administration of an antiretroviral agent to a pregnant woman in theory could reduce the risk\\r\\n      of neonatal infection by reducing the exposure of the fetus to maternal virus, or by\\r\\n      prophylaxis of the fetus prior to exposure. Because it is postulated that intense exposure of\\r\\n      a potentially uninfected fetus to HIV present in maternal blood and genital tract secretions\\r\\n      occurs during parturition, the design of this study includes intrapartum administration of\\r\\n      ZDV followed by six weeks of oral ZDV to the infant.\\r\\n\\r\\n      An identical regimen for ZDV administration was employed in ACTG Protocol 076.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Pediatric ACTG Protocol 185 evaluated the hypothesis that in HIV-infected pregnant women\\r\\n      receiving oral ZDV for medical indications, HIVIG administered monthly beginning at 20-30\\r\\n      weeks gestation in combination with intravenous ZDV intrapartum, together with a single\\r\\n      newborn dose of HIVIG within 12 hours after birth in combination with six weeks of newborn\\r\\n      oral ZDV, would reduce vertical HIV transmission compared with IVIG administered identically\\r\\n      as a control agent.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Randomized, double-blind, controlled. Approximately half of the women were given intravenous\\r\\n      HIVIG every four weeks until delivery.

In order to maximize the\\r\\n      chance for a successful transplant, it is desirable that the donor and the recipient share\\r\\n      the same Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) histocompatibility antigens. Because of the Mendelian\\r\\n      inheritance of HLA antigens, the chances of finding a match are much greater among relatives\\r\\n      than in the general population. However, only about 30 percent of patients needing a\\r\\n      transplant have a matched sibling. Thus a transplant from an HLA-matched unrelated donor may\\r\\n      be an important alternative for these patients.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Graft versus host disease is a frequent and severe complication of marrow transplantation.\\r\\n      Acute GvHD typically occurs within three months after transplantation and is characterized by\\r\\n      skin rash, liver dysfunction, and diarrhea. Although the pathophysiology of this disease is\\r\\n      not fully defined in humans, data from animal studies suggest that it is mediated by mature\\r\\n      donor T cells that react against disparate recipient histocompatibility antigens.\\r\\n\\r\\n      One treatment modality that ameliorates or prevents GvHD following allogeneic marrow\\r\\n      transplantation is T cell-depletion of donor marrow before infusion into the recipient. T\\r\\n      cell-depletion can be divided into physical methods such as separation by elutriation or\\r\\n      sheep cell rosetting, and immunologic methods which use a T cell-specific antibody(ies) plus\\r\\n      complement or toxin to kill the cells. These different techniques may remove a subpopulation\\r\\n      of T cells, all T cells, or T cells plus other cell types such as B cells or natural killer\\r\\n      (NK) cells. The number of stem cells transferred may also be affected.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Unfortunately, in many of the published studies conducted in patients receiving transplants\\r\\n      from HLA-matched siblings, T cell-depletion used to prevent or treat GvHD increased the\\r\\n      chances of other complications, namely graft failure and leukemia relapse. This is not\\r\\n      surprising in light of studies of patients with both early and advanced leukemias that\\r\\n      demonstrated a decreased risk of relapse associated with acute and/or chronic GvHD.

The utility of T-cell depletion in unrelated-donor\\r\\n      transplants needs to be determined.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The initiative grew out of increasing concern on the part of Institute staff, the bone marrow\\r\\n      transplantation community, and members of Congress that graft versus host disease is so\\r\\n      frequent and severe a complication of unrelated donor transplants that it has become a\\r\\n      limiting factor in their outcome.

Other medical condtions that deem participation to be unsafe.\\r\\n      \\n      BACKGROUND:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Between 1971 and 1980, there was a 598 percent increase in the use of platelet concentrates\\r\\n      from 0.41 million to more than 2.86 million annually. In contrast, red cell transfusions in\\r\\n      the United States rose concurrently from 6.3 million annually to 9.9 million, an increase of\\r\\n      58 percent. Although red cell transfusions have leveled or even decreased slightly in the\\r\\n      past several years, the use of platelets has continued to increase at a rate of at least 5 to\\r\\n      10 percent each year. This dramatic and continued increase in the use of platelet\\r\\n      concentrates is largely the result of treating thrombocytopenic cancer patients. In addition,\\r\\n      open heart surgery patients and others given massive transfusions also receive substantial\\r\\n      platelet support. Nevertheless, it is the chronically transfused thrombocytopenic patient who\\r\\n      frequently develops platelet alloimmunization and accounts for a large percentage of the\\r\\n      increased demand for platelets. A recent survey in a large transfusion service indicated that\\r\\n      8 percent of the patients had received 35 percent of the random-donor pooled platelet\\r\\n      concentrates. Although some alloimmunized patients can be supported by HLA-matched,\\r\\n      apheresis-donor platelets, suitably matched donors are not available in sufficient numbers\\r\\n      for every patient. Thus, platelet transfusion programs that could prevent, or at least delay\\r\\n      platelet alloimmunization would be of substantial benefit.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Limited studies have suggested several approaches that may reduce or prevent platelet\\r\\n      alloimmunization: reducing the number of foreign antigens to which a recipient is exposed by\\r\\n      providing single donor platelet apheresis products; providing leukocyte-poor blood products;\\r\\n      inactivating donor antigen presenting cells (APC\\'s), a type of lymphocyte contained within\\r\\n      the transfused platelet products, by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of platelet concentrates.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The initiative was recommended by the Blood Diseases and Resources Advisory Committee in May\\r\\n      1987 and approved by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council in September 1987.\\r\\n      The Requests for Applications were released in June 1988.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Randomized, double-blind.

The body\\r\\n      lacks any effective means for the excretion of excess iron and in patients with refractory\\r\\n      anemia, an inexorable accumulation of iron contained in transfused red cells or absorbed from\\r\\n      the diet eventually exceeds the body's capacity for safe storage. Without treatment,\\r\\n      widespread iron-induced damage to the liver, heart, pancreas, and other organs is followed by\\r\\n      an early death, most often the result of cardiac failure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Treatment with a chelating agent capable of sequestering iron and permitting its excretion\\r\\n      from the body is the most widely-used therapeutic approach. Desferrioxamine was first\\r\\n      introduced 30 years ago and is the only iron-chelating agent now in clinical use. A number of\\r\\n      recent studies have shown that regular chelation therapy with desferrioxamine can prevent\\r\\n      organ damage and improve survival in transfusion-dependent patients with thalassemia major\\r\\n      and other disorders. However, desferrioxamine given orally is poorly absorbed and to be\\r\\n      effective must be given by subcutaneous or intravenous infusion using a small portable\\r\\n      syringe pump, ideally for 12 hours each day. Compliance with this regimen is frequently poor,\\r\\n      particularly in adolescents with thalassemia major who may be at greatest risk for the lethal\\r\\n      complications of iron overload. With modern transfusion programs, one of the main threats to\\r\\n      life in patients with transfusion-dependent anemias is non-compliance with iron-chelation\\r\\n      therapy. Moreover, the cost of desferrioxamine therapy in transfusion-dependent therapy\\r\\n      exceeds $10,000 per year, in part because the drug must be isolated from bacterial cultures.\\r\\n      Despite the limitations, trials of desferrioxamine have validated iron chelation as a\\r\\n      therapeutic approach to iron overload.\\r\\n\\r\\n      PIH was first recognized as an effective iron chelator in vitro in 1979. It is easily\\r\\n      produced by the Schiff base condensation of two widely used, inexpensive drugs, vitamin B-6\\r\\n      (pyridoxal) and the antituberculous agent isoniazid. The recent Phase I studies of low-dose\\r\\n      PIH in healthy controls and volunteers with iron overload have found no evidence of toxicity\\r\\n      while producing an amount of iron excretion that would be clinically useful in the treatment\\r\\n      of non-transfusion-dependent patients with iron-loading anemias. The trial should provide\\r\\n      evidence that orally-administered PIH can be substituted for chronic subcutaneous infusions\\r\\n      of desferrioxamine in the management of iron overload in refractory anemia.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The trial was part of an Institute-initiated study on Iron Overload: Cooley's Anemia and\\r\\n      Other Disorders.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      There were three studies in the Phase II trial. Study 1 demonstrated the safety and\\r\\n      effectiveness of oral PIH in reducing the body iron burden to near-normal levels in\\r\\n      non-transfusion-dependent patients with iron-loading anemias. Study 2 demonstrated the safety\\r\\n      and effectiveness of oral PIH in maintaining near-normal body iron stores in\\r\\n      transfusion-dependent patients who had previously been well-chelated with chronic\\r\\n      subcutaneous or intravenous desferrioxamine. Study 3 demonstrated safety and effectiveness of\\r\\n      oral PIH in reducing the body iron burden to near normal levels in iron-loaded\\r\\n      transfusion-dependent patients. Studies 1 and 2 were carried out concurrently. Study 3 began\\r\\n      after the methods used in the first two studies documented a sufficient level of iron\\r\\n      excretion to permit the iron-loaded transfusion patients to keep pace with ongoing\\r\\n      transfusional loading and excrete previous accumulations of iron. After an initial 21 day\\r\\n      balance study to demonstrate that a selected dose of PIH produced sufficient iron excretion,\\r\\n      patients were begun on chronic therapy.

Agree to conditions\\r\\n        of the study and sign informed consent.\\r\\n      \\n      BACKGROUND:\\r\\n\\r\\n      In spite of the fact that advances have been made in the management or prevention of some of\\r\\n      the complications of sickle cell disease, the management of the most common complication--the\\r\\n      painful crisis--is still unsatisfactory, and appropriate methods for its prevention are\\r\\n      unknown. The morbidity associated with a painful crisis is much more than the suffering from\\r\\n      pain alone. The interference with a normal lifestyle, the resulting obstacles to obtaining an\\r\\n      education and holding a job, the risk of narcotics addiction, the cost of multiple\\r\\n      hospitalizations, and the financial impact on the family and the individual must all be\\r\\n      considered.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Evidence from the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) study showed that there is\\r\\n      an association between multiple pain events and early death in young adults. If this\\r\\n      association is true, then MSH has the potential to not only reduce morbidity but mortality as\\r\\n      well. The CSSCD study has shown that over 50 percent of patients with sickle cell disease\\r\\n      have at least one crisis per year, and a considerable number have more. These episodes are\\r\\n      believed to occur as a result of hemoglobin S within the red cells leading to rigid,\\r\\n      non-deformable cells which can no longer traverse the microvasculature and as a result\\r\\n      produce obstruction with consequent pain, ischemia, and tissue necrosis.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Previous approaches to the therapy of this group of disorders have included: attempts to\\r\\n      modify the hemoglobin molecule so as to prevent polymerization; the use of vasoreactive\\r\\n      drugs; and increasing red cell volume. All of these attempts have been abandoned either\\r\\n      because of their inefficacy, toxicity, or impracticality. Chronic exchange transfusion\\r\\n      programs have been of limited usefulness because of high rates of isoimmunization, iron\\r\\n      overload, and risk of transmission of hepatitis and retroviral disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The rationale for the present study draws its substance from the observation that patients\\r\\n      with higher levels of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) (particularly the Saudi Arabian group), and\\r\\n      infants who also have high Hb F levels have fewer crises. Several myelosuppressive drugs,\\r\\n      such as 5-azacytidine and hydroxyurea, have been shown to increase Hb F production. The work\\r\\n      with 5-azacytidine has had to be abandoned because of the known risk of malignancy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Preliminary studies by the investigators and others have shown convincingly that Hb F levels\\r\\n      can be increased by administering hydroxyurea to patients over a several month period without\\r\\n      producing dangerous levels of myelosuppression. The patients have also had a rise in their\\r\\n      red cell life span and hematocrit. Further, it has been reported that these patients had a\\r\\n      dramatic decrease in crisis frequency. This agent is readily available to all physicians, and\\r\\n      there is evidence that it is being used without adequate justification and, possibly, without\\r\\n      adequate monitoring. The timing of this study is therefore critical to ensure that an\\r\\n      adequate answer to the question of efficacy is obtained and the risk of inappropriate use\\r\\n      minimized.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Phase I has concluded. Phase II, also concluded, was a randomized, double-blind,\\r\\n      placebo-controlled trial. Patients in the Phase II trial were recruited from 21 clinics and\\r\\n      randomized to receive hydroxyurea or placebo. The hydroxyurea was gradually increased from an\\r\\n      initial dose of 15 mg/kg to the maximal level tolerated by each patient in order to maximize\\r\\n      red blood cell hemoglobin F(Hb F) content without undue marrow suppression. Changes in Hb F\\r\\n      production were monitored in each of the two groups by a variety of laboratory tests. The\\r\\n      primary endpoint was a comparison of crisis rates in the treated and control groups. Painful\\r\\n      crises were defined as pain lasting longer than four hours, requiring parenteral narcotics\\r\\n      for relief, including chest syndrome but excluding ankle ulcer pain. Secondary endpoints\\r\\n      included changes in pain severity and duration, psychosocial status, complications of the\\r\\n      disease, and reasons for non-compliance with either regimen. Patients were followed for two\\r\\n      to three years depending on when they entered the study. Because of the mutagenic nature of\\r\\n      hydroxyurea, the use of contraception was a requirement of admission to the study.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The trial was stopped early, on January 14, 1995, instead of in May 1995. The Data and Safety\\r\\n      Monitoring Board determined that daily doses of hydroxyurea reduced the frequency of painful\\r\\n      episodes and hospital admissions for those crises by about 50 percent.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Beginning in 1996, a five year follow-up of the adult patients in MSH was initiated. The\\r\\n      purpose was to ascertain the long-term effects of hydroxyurea in this patient population.\\r\\n      Patients were followed annually to determine health status, quality of life, incidence of\\r\\n      malignancies, and birth defects in their offspring. In addition, mortality rates were\\r\\n      determined so that a comparison could be made between this cohort and the mortality data from\\r\\n      the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) adult cohort and the normal\\r\\n      African-American population mortality data.

Because\\r\\n      of lack of information on the natural course of patients with Factor VIII inhibitors, the\\r\\n      relative efficacy of various modes of therapy was not established. The Division of Blood\\r\\n      Diseases and Resources decided to sponsor a clinical investigation which would evaluate\\r\\n      populations of hemophilia patients for Factor VIII inhibitors, follow up these patients to\\r\\n      provide information on the natural history of the inhibitor in the hemophilia patients, and\\r\\n      make available a reference center to monitor results and attain uniformity.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Treatment of a patient with a severe inhibitor and consequent bleeding remained a problem.\\r\\n      Management included protracted treatment with Factor VIII, use of immunosuppressive agents\\r\\n      and prothrombin complex (or Factor IX) concentrates. The rationale for Factor IX was that it\\r\\n      bypassed the defect in Factor VIII caused by the inhibitor. This method of therapy attracted\\r\\n      wide popularity, but the success was greatly debated. It was intended at the very outset of\\r\\n      the Factor VIII study that therapeutic trials involving patients with inhibitors would not be\\r\\n      a prime function, but that such studies would be monitored if necessary.

Other medical condtions that deem participation to be unsafe.\\r\\n      \\n      BACKGROUND:\\r\\n\\r\\n      ARDS affects approximately 150,000 people in the United States each year. Despite 20 years of\\r\\n      research into the mechanisms that cause this syndrome and numerous developments in the\\r\\n      technology of mechanical ventilation, the mortality has remained greater than 50 percent.\\r\\n      Many of the patients are young, and to the tragic loss of human life can be added the cost to\\r\\n      society because these patients spend an average of 2 weeks in intensive care units and\\r\\n      require multiple high tech procedures. Because of the overwhelming nature of the lung injury\\r\\n      once it is established, prevention would appear to be the most effective strategy for\\r\\n      improving the outlook in this condition.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Basic research has identified numerous inflammatory pathways that are associated with the\\r\\n      development of ARDS. Agents that block these mediators prolong survival in animals with lung\\r\\n      injury, and a few of them have been tested in patients. Because of the large number of\\r\\n      putative mediators and the variety of ways that their action can be blocked, the possibility\\r\\n      for new drug development is almost infinite. This is an exciting prospect, since it envisions\\r\\n      the first effective pharmacologic treatment for ARDS. However, preliminary clinical studies\\r\\n      have shown conflicting results, and there is an urgent need for a mechanism to efficiently\\r\\n      and effectively test new drugs in ARDS.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Treatment studies in patients with ARDS are difficult to perform for three reasons. The\\r\\n      complicated clinical picture makes it difficult to accumulate a large number of comparable\\r\\n      patients in any one center. There is no agreement on the optimal supportive care of these\\r\\n      critically ill patients. Many of the patients meeting study criteria will not be enrolled in\\r\\n      study protocols because of the acute nature of the disease process. For these reasons,\\r\\n      therapeutic trials in ARDS require multicenter cooperation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The concept for the initiative was first discussed at a meeting of the Adult Respiratory\\r\\n      Distress Syndrome Foundation and staff of the Division of Lung Diseases. The results of a\\r\\n      working meeting on uniform definitions in ARDS held at the 1992 meeting of the American\\r\\n      Thoracic Society reinforced the recommendation from the community for National Heart, Lung,\\r\\n      and Blood Institute participation in drug evaluation in ARDS. The concept for the initiative\\r\\n      was approved by the September 1992 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The\\r\\n      Requests for Proposals were released in October 1993.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      It is anticipated that over the 12-year period, several multicenter clinical trials will be\\r\\n      developed and implemented. A 12-month Phase I period was devoted to planning and developing\\r\\n      the infrastructure and committee structure and to protocol development and prioritization. In\\r\\n      Phase IIa, staff are trained in data acquisition procedures and patients are enrolled.\\r\\n      Additional protocol development may begin for subsequent studies. In Phase IIb, after the\\r\\n      last patients in the first study have completed their follow-up measurements, data will be\\r\\n      reviewed and the initial study will be closed out. Protocol development continues for\\r\\n      subsequent trials. In Phase III, final data analysis and publication preparation will occur.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Enrollment of 1,000 patients into the first ARDSNet protocol, \"Ketoconazole and Respiratory\\r\\n      Management in Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\" (KARMA) began in the\\r\\n      spring of 1996. KARMA assessed the efficacy of 6 ml/kg versus 12 ml/kg positive pressure\\r\\n      ventilation in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with acute lung injury and ARDS.\\r\\n      It also assessed the efficacy of ketoconazole, a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, in\\r\\n      reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with acute lung injury and ARDS. The\\r\\n      ketoconazole arm was stopped by the Data Monitoring Safety Board (DSMB) in January 1997 after\\r\\n      the enrollment of 234 patients. Ketoconazole did not show any benefit in survival, duration\\r\\n      of ventilation, or any measure of lung function. The ventilator arm of the protocol continued\\r\\n      until March 10, 1999, and compared the efficacy of high (12 ml/kg) and low (6 ml/kg) tidal\\r\\n      volume ventilation in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with acute lung injury and\\r\\n      ARDS. The ventilator portion of the trial was stopped on March 10, 1999, on the\\r\\n      recommendation of the DSMB when the data from the first 861 patients showed approximately 25\\r\\n      percent fewer deaths among patients receiving small, rather than large, breaths of air from\\r\\n      the mechanical ventilator.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A new drug, lisofylline, was selected to replace ketoconazole in the factorial design\\r\\n      ventilation protocol. The lisofylline study (LARMA) began in February 1998. The study tested\\r\\n      the efficacy of lisofylline, an analog of pentoxifylline, that has been shown to protect\\r\\n      against tissue injury mediated by oxidants and to suppress production of a number of cytokine\\r\\n      mediators that amplify the inflammatory process. Patients were randomized to either the high\\r\\n      or low tidal volume ventilation treatment group and between lisofylline and placebo. The aim\\r\\n      of the lisofylline protocol was to determine whether the administration of lisofylline early\\r\\n      after the onset of acute lung injury or ARDS would reduce morbidity or mortality. The study\\r\\n      was cosponsored by Cell Therapeutics Incorporated. The trial was stopped by the DSMB on May\\r\\n      27, 1999, after results were obtained on 221 patients. There was no effect on mortality, time\\r\\n      on ventilation, or organ failure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The \"Late Steroid Rescue Study (LaSRS): The Efficacy of Corticosteroids as Rescue Therapy for\\r\\n      the Late Phase of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\" (LaSRS is pronounced \"Lazarus\")\\r\\n      compared the effect of corticosteroids with placebo in the management of late-phase (greater\\r\\n      than 7 days) ARDS. The study determined if the administration of the corticosteroid,\\r\\n      methylprednisolone sodium succinate, in severe ARDS that was either stable or worsening after\\r\\n      7 days, would reduce mortality and morbidity. The primary end point was mortality at 60 days.\\r\\n      Secondary endpoints included ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days. LaSRS was\\r\\n      designed to include 400 patients and began recruiting in the spring of 1997. In October 1999,\\r\\n      the DSMB reduced the recruitment target number to 200 patients because the eligible patients\\r\\n      were fewer than anticipated.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In November 1999, the Network began a new trial as a follow-on to the ventilator trial that\\r\\n      has been named the \"Assessment of Low Tidal Volume and Elevated End-Expiratory Pressure to\\r\\n      Obviate Lung Injury\" (ALVEOLI). This trial was a prospective, randomized, controlled\\r\\n      multicenter trial that included 549 patients and compared two groups of patients. Patients\\r\\n      were randomized to receive mechanical ventilation with either lower or higher PEEP, which\\r\\n      were set according to different tables of predetermined combinations of PEEP and fraction of\\r\\n      inspired oxygen. The primary end point was mortality at 60 days. Secondary endpoints included\\r\\n      ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days. The trial has ended and results were\\r\\n      published in the July 22, 2004, issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The results\\r\\n      suggest that in patients with acute lung injury and ARDS who receive mechanical ventilation\\r\\n      with a tidal-volume goal of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and an end-inspiratory\\r\\n      plateau-pressure limit of 30 centimeters of water, clinical outcomes are similar whether\\r\\n      lower or higher PEEP levels are used.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Network investigators have developed a plan for a new protocol to assess the pulmonary artery\\r\\n      catheter (PAC) as a management tool in ARDS. The new study was prompted by recommendations\\r\\n      from the FDA/NIH Pulmonary Artery Catheter Clinical Outcomes workshop convened in August 1997\\r\\n      in response to concerns in the medical community regarding the clinical benefit and safety of\\r\\n      PACs. The new protocol in the Fluids and Catheters Treatment Trial (FACTT) is a two-by-two\\r\\n      factorial design comparing the patients receiving PAC or a central venous catheter (CVC) with\\r\\n      one of two fluid management strategies (conservative versus liberal). The randomized,\\r\\n      multicenter trial is designed to include 1,000 patients. The primary end point is mortality\\r\\n      at 60 days. Secondary endpoints include ventilator-free days and organ failure-free days. See\\r\\n      NCT00281268 for more information on this study.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Albuterol versus Placebo in Acute Lung Injury (ALTA) Study: The Phase II/III study will test\\r\\n      the safety and efficacy of aerosolized beta-2 adrenergic agonist therapy (albuterol sulfate)\\r\\n      for reducing mortality in patients with acute lung injury. In Phase II, the safety of\\r\\n      albuterol at the 5-mg dose will be compared to saline in approximately 100 patients. The dose\\r\\n      will be reduced to 2.5 mg if patients exceed defined heart rate limits. Consequently, a Phase\\r\\n      III placebo-controlled double-blinded, randomized trial on approximately 1,000 patients will\\r\\n      compare 60-day mortality and ventilator-free days to Day 28 between the safe albuterol dose\\r\\n      established in Phase II and placebo saline.\\r\\n\\r\\n      New efforts have been initiated to increase sample collection and utilize collected patient\\r\\n      materials to investigate mechanisms of ARDS pathogenesis. In addition to investigations of\\r\\n      hypotheses related to cytokines and inflammatory mediators, the Network is preparing to\\r\\n      collect samples for future studies of genetic determinants of ARDS. The ARDSNet has been\\r\\n      extended through September 2012, to continue clinical trials.\\r\\n    Warfarin50 Years21 YearsAll',\n",

Asthma complicates at\\r\\n      least 4 percent of all pregnancies; however, because at least 10 percent of the population\\r\\n      appears to have nonspecific airway hyper-responsiveness, the true prevalence may be much\\r\\n      higher.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Asthma can produce serious maternal and fetal complications. A number of investigators have\\r\\n      reported an increased incidence of pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, hyperemesis\\r\\n      gravidarum, vaginal hemorrhage, toxemia, and induced and complicated labor. Fetal\\r\\n      complications include increased risk of perinatal mortality, prematurity, low birth weight,\\r\\n      and neonatal hypoxia. In contrast, several studies have failed to confirm some or all of\\r\\n      these previous observations. Patients with severe asthma may have the greatest risk for\\r\\n      complications during pregnancy, in addition to the risk of maternal morbidity from the\\r\\n      asthma. For example, it has been shown that reduced pulmonary function in asthmatic women is\\r\\n      associated with an increased likelihood of intrauterine growth retardation. On the other\\r\\n      hand, studies in which asthma was successfully controlled have resulted in pregnancy outcomes\\r\\n      similar to the general population.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The mechanisms by which asthma may have adverse perinatal effects are not well known. Poor\\r\\n      control of asthma leading to chronic or episodic fetal hypoxia is thought to be important.\\r\\n      Medications used in asthma treatment may also play a role, although the limited data suggests\\r\\n      minimal or no effects. In addition, it is possible that extrapulmonary autonomic nervous\\r\\n      system abnormalities, such as uterine muscle hyperreactivity, could contribute to pre-term\\r\\n      delivery or gestational hypertension independent of asthma control or therapy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Unfortunately, previous studies have been limited by relatively small numbers. Few studies\\r\\n      have controlled for factors known to affect infant birth weight, such as maternal race,\\r\\n      height, weight, parity, nutrition, and cigarette smoking. Particularly, race may be an\\r\\n      important contributing factor in assessing the relationship between asthma and pregnancy\\r\\n      outcomes, since Blacks of both sexes are twice as likely to be hospitalized from asthma and\\r\\n      three times as likely to die from asthma as whites.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Under the auspices of the National Asthma Education Program (NAEP), a Working Group on Asthma\\r\\n      and Pregnancy developed a statement regarding the treatment of asthma during pregnancy. In\\r\\n      its deliberations, the Working Group noted the paucity of data on the relative contributions\\r\\n      of biological, social, and environmental factors on asthma in pregnant women, as well as the\\r\\n      lack of data on the efficacy and safety of commonly used asthma therapies in pregnancy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Asthma in Pregnancy Study evaluated the relationship between maternal asthma severity and\\r\\n      control. The primary objective was to determine the frequency of preterm delivery <32 weeks\\r\\n      among moderate and severe asthmatics compared to non-asthmatic controls. The incidence of\\r\\n      small-for-gestational-age infants in women with mild and moderate asthma was a secondary\\r\\n      outcome. Other independent variables included type of medications used, race, socioeconomic\\r\\n      status, height, weight, parity, nutrition, smoking, other substance abuse, and prenatal care.\\r\\n      Secondary outcomes included birth weight and prematurity, maternal pre-eclampsia, gestational\\r\\n      hypertension, and asthma morbidity. The study began February 1,1995 and patient recruitment\\r\\n      continued for 46 months or less.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Asthma Therapy in Pregnancy Trial was a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical\\r\\n      trial which began recruitment in November, 1996, with enrollment lasting 44 months. Patients\\r\\n      were randomized to receive either active oral theophylline and a placebo beclomethasone\\r\\n      inhaler or an active beclomethasone inhaler and placebo oral theophylline. Albuterol was used\\r\\n      for relief of symptoms. The primary outcome measure was incidence of Emergency Department\\r\\n      visits or hospitalizations during pregnancy. Secondary outcome measures included birth\\r\\n      weight, incidence of small-for-gestational-age infants, gestational hypertension,\\r\\n      pre-eclampsia, lung function, daily peak flow, and quality of life. Patients were seen\\r\\n      monthly for measurements of fetal growth, morbidity, and lung function.

It is now recognized that asthma is a complex disease of varied\\r\\n      etiology, which is triggered by a number of factors (e.g., allergens, drugs, chemicals,\\r\\n      exercise, cold air, infections, and emotions), making asthma therapy difficult and sometimes\\r\\n      complicated. Multiple drugs, including medications to treat and control symptoms\\r\\n      (bronchodilator agents such as beta-adrenergic agonists, theophylline, and anticholinergics)\\r\\n      and medications thought to control underlying airway inflammation (e.g., inhaled and systemic\\r\\n      corticosteroids, cromolyn sodium, and nedocromil), are often required.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Despite major advances in the understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of asthma and\\r\\n      the development of new therapeutic modalities, the prevalence, severity, and mortality from\\r\\n      asthma in all age groups have increased over the past decade. Mortality rates are\\r\\n      disproportionately high in urban and rural minority populations. Hospitalizations for asthma\\r\\n      have doubled in adults and increased five-fold for children over the past 20 years. Asthma\\r\\n      continues to place a heavy burden on patients and their families, the health care system, and\\r\\n      society as a whole. Therefore, new approaches are needed to help alleviate this growing\\r\\n      problem.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A particularly important need at this juncture is a mechanism for the rapid evaluation of new\\r\\n      and existing therapeutic approaches for asthma and for the dissemination of laboratory and\\r\\n      clinical findings to the health care community. The Asthma Clinical Research Network (ACRN)\\r\\n      program seeks to accomplish this through the development of a network of interactive asthma\\r\\n      clinical groups that conduct clinical studies employing common protocols in a coordinated and\\r\\n      multidisciplinary setting. This will ensure ready access to an adequate number of well\\r\\n      characterized patients from diverse populations and age groups. It will also bring together\\r\\n      and coordinate the necessary clinical expertise and administrative resources to conduct\\r\\n      multiple therapeutic studies. Centralized protocols will promote high quality design,\\r\\n      decrease the variability in supportive modalities, and reduce the redundant utilization of\\r\\n      resources required for rapidly conducting multiple independent clinical studies. The separate\\r\\n      data coordinating center supports protocol and questionnaire development, sample size\\r\\n      calculations, complete data analysis, and overall study coordination.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The initiative was developed by the Pulmonary Diseases Advisory Committee working group,\\r\\n      approved by the full committee at the February 1992 meeting, and given concept clearance by\\r\\n      the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Advisory Council in May 1992.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Beta-Agonist (Bags) study compared the safety and efficacy of regular plus \"as needed\"\\r\\n      use of inhaled albuterol to the \"as needed\" use of inhaled albuterol in 255 patients with\\r\\n      asthma of mild severity. A total of 230 patients completed the study. The study was\\r\\n      randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled with parallel groups. Following a 6-week\\r\\n      single-blind run-in period, patients were randomized in a double-blind manner and treated for\\r\\n      16 weeks. There was a 4-week withdrawal, or run-out, period. Changes in lung function and\\r\\n      asthma symptoms were assessed to determine whether regular or \"as needed\" beta-agonist use\\r\\n      was more beneficial in the treatment of mild asthma. Specific outcome measures included\\r\\n      morning (AM) PEF, airway responsiveness, spirometric values, evening (PM) to AM PEF\\r\\n      difference index, asthma symptoms, quality of life measures, use of rescue medications, and\\r\\n      episodes of adverse asthma control. Recruitment began in December 1994. The study has\\r\\n      completed and results have been published.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Colchicine in Moderate Asthma (CIMA) study examined if colchicine offered therapeutic\\r\\n      benefit in the management of 71 patients with moderate asthma when corticosteroids were\\r\\n      discontinued. The study was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled with two\\r\\n      parallel groups. A 2-week run-in with inhaled corticosteroid was followed by 2 weeks with\\r\\n      inhaled corticosteroid and colchicine or placebo, and then by 6 weeks with no inhaled\\r\\n      corticosteroid but with colchicine or placebo. There was a 6-week single-blind run-out.\\r\\n      Outcome measures included treatment failure after cessation of inhaled corticosteroid, FEV1\\r\\n      change, PM to AM PEF difference index, airway responsiveness, asthma symptoms, quality of\\r\\n      life measures, use of rescue medications, and episodes of adverse asthma control. The\\r\\n      protocol was approved in April 1994. Recruitment ran from February 1996 through August 1996.\\r\\n      Results have been published.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Salmeterol or Corticosteroids (SOCS) study was a randomized, double-blind study to\\r\\n      determine the utility of treating patients with moderately severe asthma with long-acting\\r\\n      beta-agonists in place of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). A total of 164 patients were\\r\\n      randomized into one of the following three treatment arms (double-blind and double-dummy): 1)\\r\\n      placebo; 2) inhaled corticosteroid triamcinolone alone; or 3) beta-agonist salmeterol alone.\\r\\n      Treatment continued for 16 weeks, followed by a 6-week run-out period in which all patients\\r\\n      were placed on placebo. The purpose of the run-out period was to evaluate the effects of\\r\\n      treatment cessation on asthma control. To compare efficacy of therapy, the primary outcome\\r\\n      variable was the change in AM PEF from the final week of the run-in period to the final week\\r\\n      of the double-blind treatment period. To compare duration benefit, the primary outcome\\r\\n      variable was again AM PEF, with a comparison of the change from the final week of the run-in\\r\\n      period to the second and final weeks of the run-out period. Secondary endpoints included\\r\\n      other markers of asthma severity (e.g., FEV1, symptom diaries, beta-agonist rescue,\\r\\n      quality-of-life scores, methacholine responsiveness, and asthma exacerbations). To evaluate\\r\\n      markers of inflammation, sputum induction was performed on all patients, and bronchoalveolar\\r\\n      lavage and bronchial biopsy were performed on a subset of patients. Enrollment began in\\r\\n      February 1997 and ended in July 1998. Results have been published.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Salmeterol± Corticosteroids (SLIC) study examined the addition of a long acting\\r\\n      beta-agonist, salmeterol, on a scheduled basis for patients with moderate asthma whose\\r\\n      symptoms were sub-optimally controlled by using an inhaled beta-agonist on an \"as needed\"\\r\\n      basis and an inhaled corticosteroid on a scheduled basis. The study determined if the\\r\\n      addition of salmeterol on a scheduled basis permitted a reduction in dose, and/or elimination\\r\\n      of inhaled corticosteroids over time, without a concomitant increase in asthmatic symptoms or\\r\\n      a decrease in the bronchoprotective effect to aerosolized methacholine. Recruitment of\\r\\n      randomized patients with moderate asthma began in January 1997. Additional patients were\\r\\n      randomized at the Harlem Center, a center added to the network in December 1995. The\\r\\n      enrollment of 175 patients ended in July 1998 and the last patient visits were completed in\\r\\n      January 1999. Results have been published.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Dose of Inhaled Corticosteroids with Equisystemic Effects (DICE) study estimated\\r\\n      dose-response curves with respect to adrenal suppression for six distinct inhaled\\r\\n      corticosteroids. The inhaled steroids and delivery systems were characterized in terms of\\r\\n      systemic effects so that doses that produced \"equi-systemic\" effects could be subsequently\\r\\n      compared in future efficacy studies, including the efficacy study \"Measuring Inhaled\\r\\n      Corticosteroid Efficacy\" (MICE). In DICE, a total of 156 (58% male and 31% minority) patients\\r\\n      with mild to moderate asthma had a baseline visit and a placebo run-in period to practice\\r\\n      taking scheduled doses (4 puffs twice a day) from a metered dose inhaler for 1 week. At the\\r\\n      second visit, patients were randomized to placebo or to one of the following six steroid\\r\\n      arms, including: 1) beclomethasone dipropionate metered dose inhaler (MDI); 2) budesonide dry\\r\\n      powder; 3) flunisolide MDI; 4) fluticasone propionate MDI; 5) fluticasone propionate dry\\r\\n      powder; or 6) triamcinolone acetonide MDI. The study addressed the following questions: 1)\\r\\n      Were there dose-response relationships in the suppression of overnight plasma cortisol with\\r\\n      the various inhaled corticosteroids and delivery systems?; 2) If the dose-response\\r\\n      relationships existed, at which doses were comparable systemic effects evident as determined\\r\\n      by suppression of overnight plasma cortisol?; and 3) If dose-response relationships existed,\\r\\n      which dose produced a 10%, 20%, 30%, or 40% suppression of adrenal steroid secretion\\r\\n      (cortisol) for each inhaled steroid and delivery system? DICE was initiated in September 1998\\r\\n      and completed in November 1999. Results have been published.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Measuring Inhaled Corticosteroid Efficacy (MICE) pilot study was approved by the Protocol\\r\\n      Review Committee in August 1998. MICE used doses of inhaled corticosteroid for the full MICE\\r\\n      protocol as derived from DICE, which induced minimal cortisol suppression (highest\\r\\n      deliverable dose that caused less than 5% cortisol suppression), 20% to 30% cortisol\\r\\n      suppression, and 40% to 60% cortisol suppression. The intent was to determine if different\\r\\n      inhaled corticosteroids, which had equisystemic effects, had differential salutary\\r\\n      therapeutic effects in chronic asthma, or if therapeutic efficacy paralleled systemic\\r\\n      effects. MICE was a 24-week, randomized, open-label, prospective, multi-center study\\r\\n      examining the effect of inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and fluticasone propionate\\r\\n      (FP) both with an Opti-Chamber spacer device. The inhaled corticosteroids were administered\\r\\n      to 30 patients in doses of increasing systemic effect to examine the corresponding effects on\\r\\n      pulmonary function, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, asthma control, and resolution of airway\\r\\n      inflammation in patients with persistent asthma. The intent was to compare the estimates of\\r\\n      systemic effect for BDP and FP, derived from the DICE pilot study in which BDP and FP were\\r\\n      administered in 1-week intervals, to that which occurred when BDP and FP doses were\\r\\n      administered over 3- to 6-six week intervals with incremental doses. MICE also explored which\\r\\n      efficacy/systemic relationships, if any, suggested that there may be a difference between the\\r\\n      two prototype inhaled corticosteroids, BDP and FP. Recruitment was completed in the spring of\\r\\n      2000. Results have been published.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Beta Agonist Response by Genotype (BARGE) study was reviewed by the Protocol Review\\r\\n      Committee in December 1998. Recruitment started in September 1999. BARGE was a 54-week\\r\\n      randomized, double-blind, crossover study comparing the effects of regularly scheduled use of\\r\\n      inhaled albuterol (2 puffs four times a day) to placebo. Two groups of 36 participants each\\r\\n      included individuals who had mild to moderate asthma and who differed by their genotype at\\r\\n      the codon for the 16th amino acid of the B2-adrenergic receptor. A total of 36 participants\\r\\n      harbored the B16-Arg/Arg genotype and the other 36 harbored the B16-Gly/Gly genotype at the\\r\\n      B2-adrenergic receptor. Qualified participants entered a 6-week single-blind run-in period\\r\\n      during which they were treated with an inhaled placebo (2 puffs 4 times a day) and given\\r\\n      inhaled ipratropium bromide for use as a rescue medication. Asthma control was characterized\\r\\n      by AM PEF, spirometric values, AM/PM PEF variability index, asthma symptoms, quality of life,\\r\\n      use of rescue medications, and occurrence of events of adverse asthma control. Baseline data\\r\\n      were obtained on airway responsiveness, the protective effect of albuterol against\\r\\n      methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction, the maximum bronchodilator effect of albuterol, and\\r\\n      exhaled nitric oxide. Participants were then randomized to a 16-week double-blind treatment\\r\\n      phase in which they received either inhaled albuterol or placebo (two puffs 4 times a day).\\r\\n      Asthma control was monitored by the above indicators during this time. At the end of the\\r\\n      blinded treatment period, all participants were returned to single-blind regular use of a\\r\\n      placebo inhaler (2 puffs 4 times a day) for an 8-week run-out period. Following cross-over to\\r\\n      double-blinded treatment with albuterol or placebo, the 8-week run-out period also served as\\r\\n      the run-in period for the second stage of the study. Asthma control was monitored by the same\\r\\n      indicators as in the first stage. At the end of the second blinded treatment period, all\\r\\n      participants were returned to single-blind regular use of a placebo inhaler (2 puffs 4 times\\r\\n      a day) for an 8-week run-out period. During the entire study, participants used inhaled\\r\\n      ipratropium bromide as rescue medication to avoid the confounding effects of B2-adrenergic\\r\\n      stimulation on the outcome variables to be monitored. In the event that an episode of adverse\\r\\n      asthma control responded incompletely to ipratropium, albuterol was used as a superseding\\r\\n      rescue medication. Comparisons of asthma control, within each genotypic group during periods\\r\\n      of randomized treatment, were assessed as the difference in the change in outcome variables\\r\\n      between the end of Stage 1 randomized treatment and the end of Stage 1 run-in, and between\\r\\n      the end of Stage 2 randomized treatment and the end of Stage 1 run-out. The study was\\r\\n      completed and results have been published.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Improving Asthma Control Trial (IMPACT) was a double-blind, randomized, parallel group\\r\\n      design clinical study to determine the best long-term strategy for treating adults with mild\\r\\n      asthma who experienced symptoms more than occasionally. The study tested whether these\\r\\n      patients should be taking anti-inflammatory medications on a daily basis and whether a newer\\r\\n      class of medications provided the same benefit as older drugs. In the IMPACT study, 225\\r\\n      adults with mild asthma, who had more than occasional symptoms, were enrolled in six clinical\\r\\n      research centers. Following an initial evaluation, patients were randomized to receive either\\r\\n      a twice daily inhaled corticosteroid, a twice daily anti-leukotriene, or a placebo. All\\r\\n      patients received treatment for symptoms if, and when, they occured. The primary outcome was\\r\\n      AM PEF. Other outcomes included FEV1 before and after bronchodilator treatment, the frequency\\r\\n      of exacerbations, the degree of asthma control, the number of symptom-free days, and the\\r\\n      quality of life. Recruitment ended in 2003. Study results were published in the April 14,\\r\\n      2005 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. In April 2001 NHLBI initiated an ancillary\\r\\n      study to IMPACT entitled \"Modification of Allergic Immunologic Response by Leukotriene\\r\\n      Antagonists\" under R01HL67684. The ancillary study has its own site in this database.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Smoking Modulates Outcomes of Glucocorticoid Therapy in Asthma (SMOG) study was a\\r\\n      randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, which compared the effect of inhaled\\r\\n      corticosteroid treatment delivered twice daily for 8 weeks in the following two groups of\\r\\n      patients with persistent asthma: 1) smokers; and 2) non-smokers. Smokers and non-smokers were\\r\\n      matched into pairs according to gender and FEV1 status prior to the run-in period. Each\\r\\n      member of the matched pair was randomized together to the same crossover sequence. There were\\r\\n      96 patients ages 18 to 35. The primary outcome was change in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 over the\\r\\n      8-week treatment period in smokers compared with non-smokers. Secondary outcomes were AM and\\r\\n      PM PEF, PC20 methacholine, and markers of inflammation in induced sputum. A secondary\\r\\n      comparison examined the effect of 8 weeks of treatment with a leukotriene receptor antagonist\\r\\n      in asthmatics who smoked to those who did not. An additional analysis compared the response\\r\\n      to inhaled corticosteroid with the response to leukotriene receptor antagonist. The study was\\r\\n      completed and results have been submitted to a journal for publication.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Salmeterol and Leukotriene Modifiers versus ICS Treatment (SLIMSIT) study initiated\\r\\n      recruitment in September 2002. The goal was to randomize 180 participants. SLIMSIT was a\\r\\n      36-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, with time to treatment failure\\r\\n      as the primary endpoint. Prior to each double-blind treatment phase, participants underwent a\\r\\n      4-week run-in period with combined inhaled beclomethasone HFA and the leukotriene receptor\\r\\n      antagonist (LTRA) montelukast. This was followed by 14 weeks of double-blind treatment.\\r\\n      During the initial 4-week run-in period, participants who met National Asthma Education\\r\\n      Program criteria for moderate persistent asthma received a controller regimen to obtain\\r\\n      baseline information on symptoms, beta-agonist use, and PEF for use in defining treatment\\r\\n      failure for each participant over the duration of the study. The final visit of this run-in\\r\\n      period served as the baseline of comparison for the study variables measured during the\\r\\n      initial treatment phase. At the end of the initial run-in, participants with stable asthma\\r\\n      symptoms were randomized to one of the following two treatment regimens for 14 weeks: 1)\\r\\n      daily oral placebo, twice daily inhalation of salmeterol 50 mg by dry powder inhaler (DPI),\\r\\n      and twice daily inhalation of beclomethasone HFA 80 mg by MDI; or 2) once daily oral\\r\\n      montelukast 10 mg, twice daily inhalation of salmeterol 50 mg by DPI, and twice daily\\r\\n      inhalation of placebo. Active beclomethasone HFA and the beclomethasone HFA placebo were\\r\\n      given via a MDI delivery device, while salmeterol was given by a DPI Diskusâ. A computer\\r\\n      interface randomized participants into the two treatment groups, stratifying by clinical\\r\\n      center and FEV1 at the randomization visit (less than 80% versus greater than 80% of\\r\\n      predicted FEV1). During the first treatment period, participants made three visits to the\\r\\n      clinic over 14 weeks. These visits included re-assessment of the study variables and careful\\r\\n      monitoring for increasing asthma symptoms and potential treatment failure. Subsequently,\\r\\n      participants entered a second run-in period in which they received single-blind treatment\\r\\n      with inhaled beclomethasone HFA and oral montelukast as in the first run-in period. At the\\r\\n      end of the second run-in period, participants crossed over to the alternate treatment regimen\\r\\n      for the second 14-week treatment phase, which included three visits to the clinic. These\\r\\n      visits again included re-assessment of the study variables and careful monitoring for\\r\\n      increasing asthma symptoms and potential treatment failure. DSMB recommended termination of\\r\\n      the study prior to target enrollment because sufficient data about the primary outcome had\\r\\n      been obtained. SLIMSIT results were presented at the May 2005 American Thoracic Society\\r\\n      Annual Meeting. The data are under analysis for subsequent publication.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Predicting Responses for Inhaled Corticosteroid Efficacy (PRICE) study was a follow-up\\r\\n      study that looked for additional predictive biomarkers of response to inhaled\\r\\n      corticosteroids. The study also evaluated whether short-term response to inhaled\\r\\n      corticosteroids predicted asthma control and exacerbation rate, and whether it correlated\\r\\n      with elastic recoil and upstream resistance. In this study, adults with a history of asthma\\r\\n      underwent 6 weeks of ICS treatment, then were stratified by response and randomized in a\\r\\n      double-blind fashion to continue ICS therapy or receive placebo for 16 weeks. ACRN\\r\\n      investigators found that after 6 weeks of ICS therapy, patients with a good (15%) versus poor\\r\\n      (less than 5%) increase in FEV1 experienced significantly better asthma control during\\r\\n      continued ICS treatment. Interestingly, nitric oxide concentration in exhaled breath and\\r\\n      airway sputum eosinophils, generally considered biomarkers of airway inflammation, were not\\r\\n      significantly correlated with ICS treatment response.

It is a 60-week randomized, double-blind, cross-over study to compare the effects of\\r\\n      long-acting beta-agonists in patients with asthma who are receiving inhaled corticosteroids\\r\\n      and who express two distinct polymorphisms of the beta2-adrenergic receptor. The primary\\r\\n      hypothesis is that those with the B16 Arg/Arg genotype will have worse asthma control, as\\r\\n      defined by AM PEF rate, than those with the B16 Guj/Guj genotype.

The severity of BPD, but not incidence, has been reduced\\r\\n      by surfactant therapy. BPD remains one of the most significant contributors to excessively\\r\\n      prolonged hospital stays and, therefore, potentially avoidable costs. Research leading to a\\r\\n      reduction in BPD morbidity should prove cost effective in the estimated 10,400 affected\\r\\n      infants annually (40 percent of a projected 26,000 survivors of birthweights less than 1,250\\r\\n      grams).\\r\\n\\r\\n      Inflammation is a significant component of both clinical and experimental model BPD and is\\r\\n      the subject of numerous basic science investigations begun since the empiric observation that\\r\\n      BPD responds favorably to systemic steroids. The known side effects of systemic steroids have\\r\\n      led to their cautious sequential controlled clinical investigation, initially for late\\r\\n      treatment (at more than 30 days of age), then early treatment (two weeks), then very early\\r\\n      treatment (seven days), and even prophylaxis (day one).

A severe form of chronic obstructive pulmonary\\r\\n      disease that is accompanied by weight loss is commonly referred to as pulmonary cachexia.\\r\\n      Studies in the 1960s demonstrated associations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\\r\\n      patients between weight loss, low FEV1, and early mortality. This observation was\\r\\n      strengthened by a retrospective analysis of the Intermittent Positive Pressure Breathing\\r\\n      Trial data that suggested malnutrition was an independent predictor of outcome in men with\\r\\n      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The underlying basis relating malnutrition to adverse\\r\\n      outcome in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was unknown, although there was a large body\\r\\n      of information indicating that pulmonary cachexia was associated with respiratory muscle\\r\\n      atrophy, myofibrillar substrate depletion, and impaired skeletal and respiratory muscle\\r\\n      function.

Sepsis syndrome occurs in 250,000 to 500,000 patients\\r\\n      per year with approximately one-third of these developing ARDS and other organ failures.\\r\\n      Extensive studies utilizing the sheep endotoxin model of ARDS as well as data from human\\r\\n      pilot studies suggest that cyclooxygenase inhibitors (in particular, ibuprofen) would be\\r\\n      useful in the prevention and reversal of many of the pathophysiological abnormalities related\\r\\n      to sepsis. Animal studies where ibuprofen treatment was given prior to endotoxin have shown\\r\\n      that ibuprofen can improve oxygenation, pulmonary and systematic hemodynamics, airway\\r\\n      mechanics, and lung lymph flow. Importantly, animal studies have also shown that established\\r\\n      airways mechanics abnormalities and pulmonary hypertension can be reversed by ibuprofen even\\r\\n      when given 2.5 hours post endotoxin. Pilot studies of ibuprofen in patients with sepsis\\r\\n      syndrome showed that temperature and heart rate were significantly reduced and suggested that\\r\\n      airway mechanics and oxygenation were improved, shock was reversed and that these changes\\r\\n      were temporally related to prostaglandin levels in urine and plasma.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The results of a multicenter study of ibuprofen intervention in patients with sepsis\\r\\n      performed at two medical centers between 1985 and 1987 demonstrated the antipyretic effect of\\r\\n      ibuprofen with accompanying decrease in heart rate, reduction in peak airway pressure during\\r\\n      the time of intervention, and evidence from urine assays of reduced in vivo production of\\r\\n      PGI2 and TxA2. Results suggested that PGI2 production correlated inversely with systemic\\r\\n      vascular resistance and the TxA2 production correlated directly with pPA and airway\\r\\n      resistance. Several parameters indicating beneficial effects tended toward improvement during\\r\\n      ibuprofen intervention.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The study was conducted at seven North American clinical centers and included a coordinating\\r\\n      center and a prostaglandin laboratory. Planning and completion of the protocol and manual of\\r\\n      operation took place for the first six months of the study. Patient accession extended for\\r\\n      three and a half years. Data analysis was conducted in the last year.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter. Recruitment at the seven clinical\\r\\n      sites began in October 1989 and ended in March 1995. A total of 224 patients were randomized\\r\\n      in a double-blind fashion to ibuprofen given intravenously every six hours for a total of\\r\\n      eight doses and 231 patients were randomized to placebo. The major endpoint was mortality\\r\\n      rate at 30 days after randomization. Before the first dose of the study drug, a baseline\\r\\n      medical history was taken and a physical examination was performed to document the presumed\\r\\n      cause, site, and time of onset of the sepsis syndrome. Blood was obtained for culture from at\\r\\n      least two sites. Infection was classified as occurring in the lungs, peritoneum, or urinary\\r\\n      tract or at another site or an unknown site. Chest radiographs were obtained at entry and\\r\\n      scored by the chest radiologist to indicate the presence and severity of pulmonary edema.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Baseline characteristics of the ibuprofen and placebo groups were balanced with respect to a\\r\\n      variety of measures that correlate with mortality and morbidity. The mean interval that\\r\\n      elapsed from the time the patient met the entry criteria to the administration of the study\\r\\n      drug was 10.7 +/- 0.6 hours in the ibuprofen group and 11.3 +/- 0.6 hours in the placebo\\r\\n      group. The predominant site of infection was the lung. In each group, infections associated\\r\\n      with positive blood cultures were considered to have been treated with appropriate\\r\\n      antibiotics in 96 percent of cases. Rates of organ dysfunction (organ failure) were similar\\r\\n      in the two groups at the time of randomization, except that renal dysfunction was\\r\\n      significantly more common in the placebo group.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The method of calculating the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II)\\r\\n      score was modified so that the score represented a point in time -- that is, it was\\r\\n      calculated from the baseline data rather than from the worst values obtained during the first\\r\\n      24 hours of care in the intensive care unit. Data obtained at entry and every four hours\\r\\n      thereafter for the first 44 hours and then at 72, 96, and 120 hours included the patient's\\r\\n      temperature, mean systemic blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, urinary output (as\\r\\n      an hourly average), arterial-blood gas measurements and requirements for antipyretic agents.\\r\\n      Values for mean blood pressure were calculated with the following formula: (0.33 x systolic\\r\\n      pressure) + (0.67 x diastolic pressure. When a pulmonary artery catheter was present, the\\r\\n      cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure, and central venous\\r\\n      pressure were measured at baseline and 20 hours later. Blood lactate was measured, and the\\r\\n      delivery and consumption of oxygen calculated, at baseline and 20 hours. Blood samples were\\r\\n      obtained at baseline and 20, 44, 72, and 120 hours after study entry for the measurement of\\r\\n      hemoglobin, the total leukocyte count, the platelet count, bilirubin, serum aspartate\\r\\n      aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and electrolytes.\\r\\n      Data were recorded on the patient's requirements for blood transfusion, intensive care, and\\r\\n      mechanical ventilation.\\r\\n    AmiodaroneN/A60 YearsAll\",\n",

People\\r\\n      with asthma experience well over 100 million days of restricted activity annually, and costs\\r\\n      for asthma care exceed $10 billion a year. Asthma is much more prevalent among children than\\r\\n      adults.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Hospitalizations for asthma have been increasing among children. For example, from 1979 to\\r\\n      1987, the hospital discharge rate with asthma as the first-listed diagnosis rose 43 percent\\r\\n      among children less than 15 years of age, from 19.8 to 28.4 discharges per 10,000 population.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Death rates for asthma are greater in Blacks than in whites, and the difference is\\r\\n      increasing. In 1979, Blacks of both sexes were about twice as likely to die from asthma as\\r\\n      whites. Over the past decade this ratio has increased, and by 1987 the asthma death rate was\\r\\n      almost three times greater among Blacks than whites. In children, these mortality differences\\r\\n      between Blacks and whites are even more striking.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Current knowledge about the epidemiology and natural history of childhood asthma is\\r\\n      incomplete, but the relationship between asthma early in life and development of chronic\\r\\n      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adulthood is becoming more apparent. Asthmatic\\r\\n      children with persistent and severe asthma symptoms have lower levels of lung function by\\r\\n      young adulthood than those with milder disease. Recent longitudinal studies have confirmed a\\r\\n      decrease in rate of growth of lung function as measured by FEV1 among symptomatic (primarily\\r\\n      wheeze) children compared to asymptomatic children. Among persons who develop COPD, initial\\r\\n      level of lung function is the strongest predictor of subsequent rapid decline of ventilatory\\r\\n      function.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Thus, less than maximally attained levels of lung function among children with asthma may\\r\\n      predispose them to greater than normal decline of lung function later in life. Although the\\r\\n      long-term effect of treatment on the course of asthma is not known, the treatment goal of\\r\\n      decreasing bronchial hyperresponsiveness and maximizing lung function and growth during\\r\\n      childhood may have a beneficial effect on lung health throughout life and prevent progression\\r\\n      to irreversible airflow obstruction.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Two classes of medications are currently available for treatment of\\r\\n      inflammation--corticosteroids and cromolyn sodium. Inhaled corticosteroids have significantly\\r\\n      fewer side effects than systemic administration. Corticosteroids do not inhibit the early\\r\\n      asthmatic response, but are effective in suppressing the inflammation and bronchial\\r\\n      hyperresponsiveness of the late phase response. Long-term studies of inhaled corticosteroids\\r\\n      have shown beneficial effects on lung function as measured by FEV1. However, there has been\\r\\n      concern about possible effects of long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids. Although\\r\\n      epidemiological studies of the use of inhaled corticosteroids have shown no significant\\r\\n      adverse effects, large-scale randomized controlled studies of their effects on children's\\r\\n      growth and development are needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When CAMP was initiated in the United States, bronchodilator treatment was the most common\\r\\n      approach to therapy. Two classes of bronchodilators, inhaled beta-2-adrenergic agonists and\\r\\n      oral theophylline, are most frequently prescribed for asthma. To date, no randomized,\\r\\n      controlled studies have compared the two classes of anti-inflammatory medications to each\\r\\n      other and to bronchodilator therapy on the course of asthma.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The initiative was proposed by the Pulmonary Disease Advisory Committee working group in\\r\\n      October 1987 and approved by the full committee at the February 1988 meeting and by the\\r\\n      National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council in May 1990.

Treatment remains largely supportive. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\r\\n      (NHLBI) conducted the Extracorporeal Support for Respiratory Insufficiency (ECMO,\\r\\n      Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation) trial from June 1974 through 1978. In ECMO, 90 patients\\r\\n      were randomized to either extracorporeal membrane oxygenation plus conventional therapy or to\\r\\n      conventional therapy. Survival rates were less than ten percent in both groups. The failure\\r\\n      of the trial to demonstrate the superiority of ECMO over conventional ventilatory support\\r\\n      resulted in the virtual elimination of the use of ECMO in clinical medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the earlier NHLBI trial, ECMO was implemented with a veno-arterial shunt which\\r\\n      approximated 90 percent of the baseline cardiac output. Ventilation of the lungs was\\r\\n      continued with reduced function of inspiration oxygen. Thus, the lungs were deprived of the\\r\\n      principle source of blood supply while continuously exposed to potentially injurious\\r\\n      ventilatory pressures and gas composition. The present patient trial used a new form of\\r\\n      therapy developed by Dr. Gattinoni and co-workers in Milan, Italy with the collaboration of\\r\\n      Dr. Kolobow at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda. The authors reported a 77\\r\\n      percent survival rate for the new therapy. In Step 1 of the new therapy, the patient was\\r\\n      initially ventilated with pressure-controlled, inverted ratio ventilation. If the patient did\\r\\n      not improve, Step 2 using extracorporeal perfusion was performed with a veno-venous shunt in\\r\\n      contrast to a veno-arterial shunt. The veno-venous shunt preserved pulmonary blood flow\\r\\n      whereas the veno-arterial shunt diminished it. Step 3 was reserved for those patients who did\\r\\n      not meet the therapeutic criteria of Step 2. They underwent low frequency positive-pressure\\r\\n      ventilation and extracorporeal CO2 removal involving veno-venous bypass via the internal\\r\\n      jugular and femoral or bilateral saphenous veins.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Randomized, fixed sample.

The present customary treatment of RDS with intermittent mandatory ventilation\\r\\n      is accompanied by sequelae such as extra-alveolar air leaks, intraventricular hemorrhage, and\\r\\n      bronchopulmonary dysplasia in approximately 50 percent of survivors.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn is a disorder in which the pulmonary\\r\\n      surfactant is deficient. It has not been possible to completely replace natural components of\\r\\n      surfactant with synthetic components and achieve a mixture which functions physiologically\\r\\n      like pulmonary surfactant. Therefore, studies of replacement therapy for surfactant\\r\\n      deficiency have used complete natural surfactants or derivatives of natural surfactant which\\r\\n      contain the defined components of surfactant. The surfactant used in the clinical trial was\\r\\n      derived from human amniotic fluid.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Two basic different strategies for surfactant treatment of respiratory distress syndrome have\\r\\n      emerged: prophylactic, or preventilatory, treatment at or shortly after birth versus rescue\\r\\n      treatment after the initiation of mechanical ventilation in instances of clinically confirmed\\r\\n      respiratory distress syndrome. Although treatment at birth has the theoretic advantage of\\r\\n      delivering surfactant more uniformly to the airways before mechanical ventilation, it has the\\r\\n      disadvantages of delaying physiologic stabilization after birth and resulting in unnecessary\\r\\n      treatment, at considerable cost, of 20 percent to 40 percent of infants born at or less than\\r\\n      30 weeks of gestation. Rescue therapy permits early physiologic stabilization and\\r\\n      confirmation of respiratory distress syndrome, but with the theoretic disadvantages of early\\r\\n      lung injury from mechanical ventilation in the surfactant-deficient lung and less uniform\\r\\n      surfactant distribution. Previous comparative trials have been biased by incomplete study\\r\\n      enrollment and inclusion of infants in preventilation treatment groups without evidence of\\r\\n      surfactant deficiency or immaturity. In addition, outcomes have varied in placebo-treated\\r\\n      infants.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Randomized, placebo-controlled.

Of 282 potentially\\r\\n      eligible infants, 246 received treatments at birth and 200 had respiratory distress syndrome\\r\\n      and received the full course of surfactant therapy. Preterm infants randomly assigned to\\r\\n      receive prophylactic treatment received surfactant soon after birth; those assigned to\\r\\n      receive rescue surfactant had instillation at a mean age of 220 minutes if the\\r\\n      lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio was _ 2.0 and no phosphatidylglycerol was detected in either\\r\\n      amniotic fluid or initial airway aspirate, oxygen requirements were a fraction of inspired\\r\\n      oxygen of > 0.5 and mean airway pressure was _ 7 cm H20 from 2 to 12 hours after birth.

Varying\\r\\n      degrees of bronchoreactivity occur over the entire spectrum. Asthma and COPD have many\\r\\n      features in common. Distinction is usually dependent on clinical features and clinical\\r\\n      course. The diagnosis of asthma will not exclude a patient from the designation of COPD for\\r\\n      this study, although criteria for exclusion include recent (within six months) use of inhaled\\r\\n      or oral steroid with the intent of excluding most of those who are clearly predominantly\\r\\n      bronchospastic. The morbid anatomy of COPD is well described and includes many features of\\r\\n      acute and chronic inflammation. There is well supported evidence in the literature that this\\r\\n      inflammatory process may be an important pathogenetic mechanism in the development of\\r\\n      emphysema. On this basis, the rationale for the use of corticosteroids is well justified.\\r\\n      There are various published studies suggesting that inhaled steroids reduce bronchial lavage\\r\\n      markers of inflammation, variously influence short-term bronchial hyperreactivity, improve\\r\\n      lung function acutely or short-term, and slow rate of decline in lung function. Most studies\\r\\n      have asked for improvement rather than stability. However, despite the studies which do not\\r\\n      support these contentions and the lack of long-term information, inhaled steroids in COPD are\\r\\n      becoming widely used in clinical practice.

If inspiratory muscles fail, so does ventilation and tissue\\r\\n      respiration. There are theoretical reasons to postulate inspiratory muscle failure in chronic\\r\\n      obstructive pulmonary disease, and suggestions that it may occur in an acute form with\\r\\n      exacerbations and in a chronic form during 'stability'. There are two therapeutic strategies\\r\\n      available for prevention and treatment of inspiratory muscle fatigue: training inspiratory\\r\\n      muscles to increase their efficiency and resting fatigued muscles. The former should work if\\r\\n      chronic fatigue is not present, and the latter should allow recovery from chronic fatigue, so\\r\\n      the two approaches are not necessarily mutually exclusive. This proposal was originally\\r\\n      designed to test the efficacy of each of these therapies alone and also in combination;\\r\\n      however, given the experience of a pretrial period, these goals were scaled back.

If current trends continue, it may\\r\\n      become the nation's fourth or even third leading cause of death by the year 2000.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Epidemiological studies consistently indicated that smoking was the over-whelming risk factor\\r\\n      for accelerated decline in pulmonary function and subsequent development of COPD.\\r\\n      Furthermore, evidence from several studies indicated that the rate of decline in pulmonary\\r\\n      function approached a more normal rate of decline upon cessation of cigarette smoking.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Another presumed risk factor for accelerated decline in pulmonary function was the presence\\r\\n      of hyperreactive airways, although it was not clear whether the mere presence of\\r\\n      hyperreactive airways contributed to the accelerated decline, or whether the decline resulted\\r\\n      from the reaction of the airways to various irritants over a long period of time. It is\\r\\n      possible that if the hyperreactive airway was kept non-reactive by pharmacological means over\\r\\n      a period of years, the expected abnormal decline might be lessened.

Estimates suggested there were about half a\\r\\n      million episodes of pulmonary embolism in hospitalized patients each year in the United\\r\\n      States. Deaths attributable to pulmonary embolism would be expected in about one third of\\r\\n      these patients if left untreated.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was subject to a high frequency of false\\r\\n      positives and false negatives. The most definitive diagnostic procedure was pulmonary\\r\\n      angiography, an invasive, expensive procedure which was not without risk. It required\\r\\n      specialized equipment and highly trained personnel both for performance and for\\r\\n      interpretation. Therefore, it was used to diagnose pulmonary embolism only in the major\\r\\n      medical centers. Another technique utilized as a method to diagnose pulmonary embolism\\r\\n      involved a combination of perfusion and ventilation scanning; this method was only minimally\\r\\n      invasive. A normal perfusion scan was thought to be of considerable value because it\\r\\n      essentially excluded the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. In selected patient populations,\\r\\n      abnormal perfusion scans combined with normal ventilation scans were of substantial help in\\r\\n      diagnosis.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Although there had been no acceptable validation of the use of perfusion scans in the\\r\\n      diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, thousands of patients had been evaluated for pulmonary\\r\\n      embolism based on perfusion scanning often using methods of imaging now considered to be\\r\\n      inadequate. In the early 1980s, clinical practice interpreted a negative perfusion scan as\\r\\n      overwhelming evidence against the presence of pulmonary emboli. This interpretation had not\\r\\n      been adequately tested either in a prospective study or by long-term follow-up of patients to\\r\\n      determine clinical outcome. With regards to positive perfusion scans, there were data to\\r\\n      suggest that as many as two-thirds of positive perfusion scans could not subsequently be\\r\\n      confirmed by pulmonary angiography. Prospective studies in which timely angiograms using\\r\\n      selective injections and improved imaging techniques were needed to evaluate the usefulness\\r\\n      of positive perfusion scans.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Phase I was initiated in September 1983.

The economic impact of the disease in 1972\\r\\n      amounted to $803 million in the direct costs of disability treatment, $3.05 billion in\\r\\n      disability costs, and $645 million in lost earnings due to premature death.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Motivated in part by the significant toll of this disease, a conference on the Scientific\\r\\n      Basis of Respiratory Therapy, co-sponsored by the American Thoracic Society and the Division\\r\\n      of Lung Diseases, examined the current status of the use of oxygen therapy in chronic lung\\r\\n      disease.

Both barotrauma and oxygen\\r\\n      toxicity had been considered in the pathogenesis of these disorders; circulatory disorders as\\r\\n      a result of failure of closure of the ductus arteriosus or fluid overload had also been\\r\\n      proposed as contributory factors. Reports of successful application of the principles of high\\r\\n      frequency ventilation (HFV) in the treatment of infants with RDS and particularly those with\\r\\n      severe interstitial emphysema raised hopes that this technique might prevent barotrauma to\\r\\n      the lungs and stimulated physicians and engineers to develop new equipment useful in\\r\\n      ventilating small infants.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Although HFV had not been evaluated either with regard to efficacy or safety and although\\r\\n      results of fundamental studies had not provided a good understanding of how gas exchange\\r\\n      occurred during HFV, there was considerable interest in introducing this type of ventilatory\\r\\n      support in neonatal intensive care. HFV involves the use of small tidal volumes, delivered at\\r\\n      respiratory frequencies ranging from 1 to 40 Hz with the aid of, for example, a piston pump\\r\\n      or a high speed jet of gas. Compared to conventional mechanical ventilation, HFV offers\\r\\n      several potential advantages, including reduced intrapulmonary pressure swings and\\r\\n      fluctuation in alveolar pressures and the possibility of lowered levels of inspired oxygen.\\r\\n      At that time, theories suggested that HFV produced a pattern of flow that enhanced gas mixing\\r\\n      and 'homogenized' the distribution of ventilation. Experimental observations in adult animals\\r\\n      (cats, dogs and rabbits) or healthy newborn lambs had shown HFV to be effective in promoting\\r\\n      gas exchange without apparent adverse effects. Studies in prematurely delivered subhuman\\r\\n      primates, that develop RDS and subsequently bronchopulmonary dysplasia indistinguishable from\\r\\n      that of human infants, supported the notion the HFV could provide better oxygenation and\\r\\n      lower C02 levels than conventional mechanical ventilation at similar mean airway pressure.\\r\\n      The HIFI trial provided badly needed controlled data on the safety and efficacy of HFV in\\r\\n      premature infants.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Phase I, the Planning Phase, was initiated in August 1984.

Initially, pacing was primarily confined to ventricular pacing with\\r\\n      limited sensing, programming and pacing capacity. Tremendous growth has occurred in pacing\\r\\n      technology, making available dual chamber pacing with sophisticated sensing, pacing, and rate\\r\\n      control. These more advanced pacemakers are more costly and complicated to place surgically.\\r\\n\\r\\n      One of the most common indications for pacing is sick sinus syndrome. Initial therapy is\\r\\n      usually medical to inhibit the tachyarrhythmias (most commonly paroxysmal atrial\\r\\n      fibrillation). However, if symptomatic bradycardia results, then permanent pacing is commonly\\r\\n      employed. The appropriate type of pacing in this setting is not clearly defined and is\\r\\n      controversial.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The development of atrioventricular pacing was principally aimed at improving cardiac\\r\\n      hemodynamics and creating a more physiological heart rate control. Hemodynamic studies have\\r\\n      clearly shown the benefit of this approach in many patients, particularly those with\\r\\n      decreased left ventricular compliance in whom atrial activity contributes significantly to\\r\\n      cardiac output. Lack of synchronization between the upper and lower chambers of the heart\\r\\n      caused by pacing the ventricle alone can result in a constellation of symptoms commonly\\r\\n      referred to as \"pacemaker syndrome\".\\r\\n\\r\\n      The underlying mechanisms by which dual chamber pacing is purported to improve outcome is\\r\\n      straightforward; in patients with normal sinus rhythm, cardiac output is improved by 15 to 30\\r\\n      percent. In addition, a number of retrospective studies that have compared single chamber\\r\\n      with atrial-based or dual chamber pacing have suggested that the latter may prevent adverse\\r\\n      clinical events such as atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, cerebral vascular\\r\\n      accidents, and death. While none of these studies was a randomized trial, the literature is\\r\\n      consistent with a concept that dual mode pacing results in improved hemodynamics and a more\\r\\n      favorable outcome in patients with sick sinus syndrome. However, the data do not provide\\r\\n      definitive answers because of small sample sizes and methodological problems. A major\\r\\n      problems with all previous studies is probable selection bias favoring implantation of dual\\r\\n      chamber devices in younger, healthier patients.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Several small studies have compared functional status and other quality of life measures\\r\\n      between single and dual chamber pacing modes and have suggested better quality of life\\r\\n      outcomes for the dual chamber mode. Again, these conclusions are severly hampered by the\\r\\n      sample sizes, the lack of random assignment or adequate statistical adjustment to control for\\r\\n      confounding, use of outdated and/or invalid measures, and potential response bias due to\\r\\n      awareness of mode assignment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      A multicenter, randomized clinical trial. All patients received a dual chamber pacemaker\\r\\n      capable of either single or dual chamber rate modulated pacing. Patients were then randomized\\r\\n      to either the single chamber mode or the dual chamber mode. Patients with prior stroke were\\r\\n      pre-stratified. Clinical and electrocardiographic data were collected during a 1.5 to 4.5\\r\\n      year follow-up. The primary endpoint was either: first occurrence of stroke, or; total\\r\\n      (all-cause) mortality. Secondary endpoints included health status, cost-effectiveness,\\r\\n      cardiovascular mortality, composite of any of the three major adverse effects expected in\\r\\n      sick sinus syndrome patients (total mortality alone or first stroke or congestive heart\\r\\n      failure hospitalization), first occurrence of atrial fibrillation, heart failure score,\\r\\n      pacemaker syndrome, health status in women and in the elderly, and outcome of patients with\\r\\n      risk factors for pacemaker syndrome.

Management of atrial\\r\\n      fibrillation remains controversial, and although antiarrhythmic drugs are widely used for\\r\\n      this condition, clinical studies to support their use are meager. Management of atrial\\r\\n      fibrillation has at least three components: restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm;\\r\\n      heart rate control when maintenance of sinus rhythm or when cardioversion is not attempted or\\r\\n      impossible; and anticoagulation. The first component of management uses antiarrhythmic drugs\\r\\n      and the second uses a different group of antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation. The\\r\\n      third is anticoagulant therapy for patients in whom normal sinus rhythm cannot be maintained\\r\\n      or in whom cardioversion is not attempted.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The initiative was developed by staff of the Clinical Trials Branch and the NHLBI Working\\r\\n      Group on Atrial Fibrillation which met in Bethesda in April, 1993.

The trial enrolled only patients with atrial fibrillation who\\r\\n      were at high risk for stroke, that is, over 65 years of age or less than 65 and with one or\\r\\n      more other risk factors for stroke such as systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus,\\r\\n      congestive heart failure, transient ischemic attack, prior cerebral vascular accident. High\\r\\n      risk patients were treated with the anticoagulant warfarin. Cardioversion (electrical or\\r\\n      pharmacologic) might have been attempted before randomization, but if it was unsuccessful,\\r\\n      the patient was excluded from further consideration for randomization. Normal sinus rhythm\\r\\n      must have persisted for one hour or greater after cardioversion to qualify as successful\\r\\n      cardioversion. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups which included maintenance\\r\\n      of sinus rhythm or heart rate control. Both treatment groups had two steps.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the maintenance of sinus rhythm group, the choice of drugs was left to the primary\\r\\n      treating physician, to be chosen from amiodarone, sotalol, propafenone, flecainide,\\r\\n      quinidine, moricizine, disopyramide, procainamide, and combinations of these drugs.\\r\\n      Atrioventricular nodal blocking drugs were also administered unless contraindicated. The\\r\\n      major substudy for AFFIRM randomized initial drug choice among amiodarone, sotalol, and class\\r\\n      I drugs. Prior drugs which were ineffective or poorly tolerated were not repeated. There were\\r\\n      various drug exclusions depending on the patient's condition. Patients in the maintenance of\\r\\n      sinus rhythm group had multiple cardioversions as needed. If there was treatment failure or\\r\\n      intolerance after two or more pharmacologic trials, patients were considered for innovative\\r\\n      therapy in Step II. In Step II, two maintenance doses of amiodarone were included, a low dose\\r\\n      of 100 to 200 mg/day and a normal dose of 300 to 400 mg/day. Each dose of amiodarone was\\r\\n      considered to be a single drug trial, so that patients who received treatment with amiodarone\\r\\n      at both dosage levels were considered to have had two drug trials. It was not mandatory that\\r\\n      Step II therapies be applied in any individual patient. The following innovative Step II\\r\\n      therapies were approved for use in the study: (1) ablation of an atrial focus in patients\\r\\n      with type I atrial flutter, if it was clinically documented that the atrial flutter led to\\r\\n      atrial fibrillation; (2) atrial pacing alone, with or without documented bradycardia; (3)\\r\\n      atrial pacing and antiarrhythmic drugs, with either single site or multiple site atrial\\r\\n      pacing; and (4) surgical maze or atrial isolation procedures at selected centers.\\r\\n      Catheter-based ablative procedures, such as those attempting to mimic the maze procedure were\\r\\n      not approved in this study. Implanted atrial cardioverter defibrillators were also not\\r\\n      approved. All therapy was periodically reviewed and subject to modification by the Steering\\r\\n      Committee with concurrence by the DSMB and the NHLBI. In the event that sinus rhythm was not\\r\\n      maintainable by any treatment, patients crossed over to rate control and anticoagulation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The heart rate control arm used heart rate as the therapeutic target, rather than dose of\\r\\n      medications. Drug dosage was adjusted to achieve target heart rates. During atrial\\r\\n      fibrillation, heart rate was assessed both at rest and during activity at each clinic visit.\\r\\n      The pharmacologic therapies approved for use in this arm included: beta blockers, verapamil,\\r\\n      diltiazem, digoxin, or combinations of these drugs . When Step I pharmacologic therapies\\r\\n      failed after two or more drug trials, the treating physician could select an approved Step II\\r\\n      innovative therapy. The two innovative therapies approved for use with the heart rate control\\r\\n      arm were: (1) atrioventricular node modification by catheter ablation, with or without\\r\\n      placement of a pacemaker, with or without continued drugs to slow atrioventricular node\\r\\n      conduction, and (2) total atrioventricular junctional ablation and placement of a pacemaker.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The primary endpoint by which the two strategies were compared was total mortality, analyzed\\r\\n      by intention-to-treat.

Ischemic heart disease\\r\\n      claims the lives of nearly 250,000 women in the United States each year. Recognition of\\r\\n      ischemic heart disease in women is a major challenge to the primary care physician. Diagnosis\\r\\n      of ischemic heart disease requires recognition of clinical symptoms such as chest pain, or\\r\\n      events such as a myocardial infarction, which are evaluated by a physician who will confirm\\r\\n      the diagnosis with objective tests. Unfortunately, both symptom recognition and diagnostic\\r\\n      tests confuse rather than confirm a diagnosis of myocardial ischemia in women. Chest pain\\r\\n      syndromes suspicious for myocardial ischemia are common in women. Noninvasive diagnostic\\r\\n      methods which often confirm the diagnosis and assess disease severity in men are less\\r\\n      reliable in women. This lack of objective data to support the diagnosis of chronic or acute\\r\\n      myocardial ischemia may influence the physician's decision to further evaluate women at risk.\\r\\n      With precision in diagnosis, efforts to optimize therapies are hampered.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The detection of epicardial coronary atherosclerosis is a major objective in clinical\\r\\n      cardiology. The utility of this approach is well established. However, although the presence\\r\\n      of atherosclerosis is sufficient to cause myocardial ischemia, whether significant ischemia\\r\\n      or risk of ischemia exists in the absence of angiographic epicardial stenosis, is not known\\r\\n      and may be important for women.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Recent progress in understanding the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia provides a more\\r\\n      complex causal pathway than the heretofore notion of fixed atherosclerotic obstructions in\\r\\n      passive conduits. Diseased arteries which may appear angiographically normal as well as\\r\\n      arteries with fixed obstructions can respond to vasomotor influences with a detrimental\\r\\n      amount of vasoconstriction. The endothelium generates vasoactive and anticoagulant factors\\r\\n      that are important mediators of thrombosis. Cycling hormones may further influence these\\r\\n      complex interactions. Methods which do not rely solely on fixed obstruction of epicardial\\r\\n      arteries are not only possible but may be useful to recognize early atherosclerosis or, for\\r\\n      example, endothelial dysfunction which places the patient at risk for untoward coronary\\r\\n      events.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The concept for the study was developed by the Cardiology Advisory Committee in collaboration\\r\\n      with staff and was approved by the May 1993 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council.\\r\\n      The Request for Proposals was released in April 1994.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) was a four center study designed to evaluate\\r\\n      ischemic heart disease and its pathophysiology in women. WISE testing focused on three areas:\\r\\n      1) optimizing symptom evaluation and diagnostic testing for ischemic heart disease; 2)\\r\\n      exploring mechanisms for symptoms and evidence of myocardial ischemia in the absence of\\r\\n      epicardial coronary artery disease; 3) evaluating the influence of reproductive hormones on\\r\\n      symptoms and diagnostic test response. The WISE core data base included demographic and\\r\\n      clinical data, symptom and psychosocial variables, coronary angiography and ventriculography\\r\\n      data, blood lipoprotein/homocysteine/lipid peroxidation/genetic/hormone/ phytoestrogen\\r\\n      analysis, brachial artery reactivity testing, and resting/ambulatory electrocardiographic\\r\\n      (ECG) monitoring. Site specific complementary methods included physiologic and functional\\r\\n      cardiovascular assessments of myocardial perfusion and metabolism, ventriculography,\\r\\n      endothelial vascular function and coronary angiography. Women were followed for at least one\\r\\n      year to assess clinical events and symptom status. In the Phase I (1996-7), a pilot phase,\\r\\n      256 women were studied. Phase II has completed enrolling 1008 women in the study. The WISE\\r\\n      study defined contemporary and comprehensive state-of-the-art diagnostic testing to evaluate\\r\\n      women with suspected ischemic heart disease, and explore sex specific ischemic heart disease\\r\\n      pathophysiology.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The study has been renewed through April, 2005 to extend patient follow-up for a minimum of\\r\\n      five years. Dr. Kelsey (U01HL64829) of the Data Coordinating Center at the University of\\r\\n      Pittsburgh will continue the follow-up, develop sex-specific incremental outcome models to\\r\\n      evaluate the prognostic value of female reproductive variables, assess cost effectiveness of\\r\\n      the WISE testing techniques, and continue data analyses. Dr. Reis (U01HL64914) will study the\\r\\n      immunologic basis of coronary disease in women, focusing on the role of inflammation and\\r\\n      cytokine production. He will measure several cytokines and cytokine-related proteins and\\r\\n      genotypes in approximately 900 stored samples from WISE participants. Dr. Pepine (U01HL64924)\\r\\n      will study the renin angiotensin system in coronary microvascular dysfunction, focusing on\\r\\n      whether polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin/kallikrein-kinin systems and beta-adrenergic\\r\\n      receptors polymorphisms are associated with abnormal coronary microvascular function\\r\\n      determined by coronary flow reserve measurements.\\r\\n    PlasminogenN/A18 YearsAll\",\n",

Low HDLc levels are\\r\\n      strong, independent predictors of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality risk,\\r\\n      equally so for both men and women. This high coronary artery disease risk may be due to an\\r\\n      imbalance between delivery of cholesterol into the arterial intima by LDL and its removal by\\r\\n      HDL. Also, since HDL serve as antioxidants and cytoprotectants, an important HDL role may be\\r\\n      to prevent LDL oxidation and thus limit macrophage-mediated intimal lipid accumulation or to\\r\\n      prevent vascular cell toxicity. Recent epidemiologic, experimental, and clinical trial\\r\\n      evidence suggests that a 15 mg/dl rise in HDL cholesterol would reduce coronary artery\\r\\n      disease incidence and mortality by 30 to 70 percent and that antioxidant vitamins E, C, and\\r\\n      beta-carotene might reduce coronary artery disease events and atherogenesis. The potential\\r\\n      absolute benefit is much greater in those with existing coronary artery disease. It has also\\r\\n      been shown that HDLc rises in response to exercise, smoking cessation, weight reduction, and\\r\\n      monounsaturated fats.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Randomized, Phase III.

Although the onset of coronary artery disease is delayed in\\r\\n      women, it is the single most important cause of death in women over the entire life span.\\r\\n      Indeed, because more women than men survive to old age, mortality due to coronary artery\\r\\n      disease for all ages combined is as great in women as in men. Furthermore, once they present\\r\\n      with clinical evidence of coronary artery disease, women have a prognosis as poor as, or even\\r\\n      worse, than that for men. In part, this may be due to late recognition of coronary artery\\r\\n      disease in women, less intensive treatment of women, or a more adverse risk profile in women\\r\\n      who develop coronary artery disease. The report of a recent Working Group on Angiographic\\r\\n      Trials of Atherosclerosis Prevention notes that, compared to males, females who develop\\r\\n      coronary artery disease, have various different characteristics which may affect the vascular\\r\\n      response to lipid-altering interventions. These differences led the report to question\\r\\n      whether the mechanisms and clinical benefits of lipid-altering agents may be different in men\\r\\n      and women. It further noted that angiographic trials conducted to date have been based\\r\\n      primarily upon the cholesterol-lowering treatments of diet or drugs and suggested that other\\r\\n      approaches based upon the lipid hypothesis could profitably be tested and should be given the\\r\\n      highest priority at this time; specifically recommended were trials of hormone replacement\\r\\n      and antioxidant therapy in women.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Subjects were randomized into a 2 x 2 factorial trial of hormone replacement therapy and\\r\\n      antioxidant therapy.

Studies show substantial delay times from AMI\\r\\n      symptoms to hospital arrival, with means ranging from 4.6 to 24 hours and medians from 2 to\\r\\n      6.4 hours. EMS transport time is estimated to average 7 to 22 minutes, so a large portion of\\r\\n      pre-hospital delay is attributable to patient recognition and action. Several factors have\\r\\n      been associated with delay time. Sudden onset pain is associated with shorter delay times,\\r\\n      and older age, female gender, African-American race, consultation with others about symptoms,\\r\\n      and self-treatment programs are associated with longer delay times. There is a need for\\r\\n      educational programs that are effective in decreasing delay times, particularly by focusing\\r\\n      on people who are at increased risk of having an AMI and groups more likely to delay seeking\\r\\n      treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Community interventions to reduce delay time between AMI symptoms and contact with the\\r\\n      medical system have been conducted in Britain, Canada, Sweden, Australia, Germany, King\\r\\n      County in Washington, and Jacksonville, Illinois. The interventions have been promising, but\\r\\n      the studies suffer from problems that make the reported results difficult to interpret.\\r\\n      Almost all the published studies assessed delay time pre-to-post intervention and had no\\r\\n      control or comparison group, making the magnitude and significance of impact from the\\r\\n      intervention difficult to determine. Most were conducted in countries other than the United\\r\\n      States, so applicability to the health-care system in the United States is questionable.\\r\\n      Although some examined the effect of a public education program on ambulance and ED\\r\\n      utilization, the effects of public education campaigns on use of the EMS or ED remains\\r\\n      unanswered.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The study was a multicenter, controlled community trial where the community was the unit of\\r\\n      assignment and of analysis. Twenty study communities were pair-matched on demographics and\\r\\n      one of each pair was randomly assigned to intervention and one to control. The intervention\\r\\n      communities received an 18-month community-based intervention to reduce delay time for\\r\\n      symptoms and signs of AMI, focusing on decreasing the delay time associated with patient\\r\\n      recognition and action. Several methods were used including: educational interventions based\\r\\n      on behavior change theory; patient and provider education; public education and community\\r\\n      organization. The primary outcome was time from symptom onset to arrival at the emergency\\r\\n      department.

Previous research on non-Indian populations indicates that obesity is an independent\\r\\n      risk factor for cardiovascular disease and that it is associated with increases in other\\r\\n      cardiovascular disease risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and low high\\r\\n      density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The high prevalence of obesity among American\\r\\n      Indians, coupled with its role as a risk factor for hypertension, coronary heart disease, and\\r\\n      diabetes, suggests that a reduction in the average weight of young American Indians would\\r\\n      improve their health. Reduction of the prevalence of obesity in American Indians has been\\r\\n      designated as a goal for improving the health of this minority population and reducing health\\r\\n      disparities in our nation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The successful 4-1/2 year feasibility study was followed by the full-scale randomized trial\\r\\n      involving 1,700 American Indian elementary schoolchildren. Schools were the unit of\\r\\n      randomization.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The initiative was developed as a result of consultations with the NHLBI Ad Hoc Committee on\\r\\n      Minority Populations, the Conference on Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease in Minority\\r\\n      Populations, and the Indian Health Service. The need for the study was reinforced by the\\r\\n      preliminary data from the Strong Heart Study confirming the high prevalence of obesity in\\r\\n      American Indians. The initiative was approved by the Clinical Applications and Prevention\\r\\n      Advisory Committee in February 1992 and given concept clearance by the National Heart, Lung,\\r\\n      and Blood Advisory Council in May 1992.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Feasibility Phase of the trial was completed in 1995. The organizational structure has\\r\\n      been established, validation studies to determine an endpoint and formative assessment of the\\r\\n      tribe communities was completed. Intervention including classroom curriculum, food service,\\r\\n      physical activity family component and for the measurement methods including obesity,\\r\\n      physical activity, diet intake, knowledge, attitudes and behavior, and process evaluation\\r\\n      were completed.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The full-scale trial started in September 1996. The primary aim was to test the effectivenes\\r\\n      of a culturally appropriate school-based intervention that promoted increased physical\\r\\n      activity and healthful eating behaviors to prevent obesity in American Indian upper\\r\\n      elementary school children. The primary outcome was percent body fat after three years of\\r\\n      intervention. The major hypothesis was that intervention would result in an absolute\\r\\n      difference of 3 percent body fat between the control and intervention schools. All students\\r\\n      enrolled in the second grade in the participating schools during Spring, 1997 participated in\\r\\n      the baseline survey. Baseline measurements were performed at the end of second grade so that\\r\\n      the intervention could begin at the start of third grade. The intervention lasted for three\\r\\n      years. A single cohort of children progressed through third, fourth, and fifth grades.\\r\\n      Schools were the unit of randomization. Forty-one schools in four centers were stratified\\r\\n      within each field center on median percent body fat (PBF) at the end of second grade using\\r\\n      data from the baseline measurement.

Currently, three specific diet-related factors have been recommended by the\\r\\n      Joint National Committee on High Blood Pressure as a first-line approach in preventing and\\r\\n      treating hypertension: caloric restriction for weight reduction, reduced consumption of\\r\\n      alcohol, and lower sodium intake. Many studies, primarily observational, have shown\\r\\n      significant associations between blood pressure and other diet-related factors, including\\r\\n      micronutrients such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium; macronutrients such as type and\\r\\n      amount of dietary fats, particularly polyunsaturated, and protein; and dietary fiber.\\r\\n      However, results from individual, randomized, controlled clinical trials testing the effects\\r\\n      of these nutrients on blood pressure have been inconsistent and equivocal. On the other hand,\\r\\n      both observational and randomized intervention studies have consistently linked vegetarian\\r\\n      dietary patterns to lower blood pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\n      To determine which specific dietary component may account for the blood pressure-lowering\\r\\n      effect produced by vegetarian diets, numerous studies have examined individual\\r\\n      micronutrients, macronutrients, and fiber. A large majority of cross-cultural and\\r\\n      observational studies have shown a significant inverse association of blood pressure with the\\r\\n      micronutrients, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, while the evidence linking dietary fiber\\r\\n      to lower blood pressure comes primarily from studies on vegetarian and other high fiber\\r\\n      diets. However, only a few of numerous clinical trials found that potassium or calcium\\r\\n      supplements lower blood pressure. Randomized trials of magnesium supplementation generally\\r\\n      have not shown a significant reduction in blood pressure. The few intervention studies of\\r\\n      fiber supplements likewise generally have not demonstrated significant lowering of blood\\r\\n      pressure. Pooled estimates from meta-analyses of potassium and calcium trials have reported\\r\\n      small but significant reductions in systolic (potassium and calcium) and diastolic\\r\\n      (potassium) blood pressure. All of these results are compatible with small effects of\\r\\n      individual dietary components.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Only a few observational and intervention studies have demonstrated a relationship between\\r\\n      the macronutrients, dietary fats or protein, and blood pressure. However, recent data\\r\\n      analyses shown significant direct associations with saturated fat and dietary cholesterol,\\r\\n      and inverse associations with protein intake.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Thus, an overall summary of the literature suggests that there is strong potential for a\\r\\n      number of macronutrients and micronutrients to play an important role in reducing blood\\r\\n      pressure. Testing dietary patterns rather than specific nutrients is a promising approach\\r\\n      because it is not yet known which nutrients might be most effective in lowering blood\\r\\n      pressure and because the effect of individual nutrients may be small. Testing dietary\\r\\n      patterns would naturally include several nutrients that cumulatively are likely to lower\\r\\n      blood pressure. Furthermore, most intervention studies which have not demonstrated decreases\\r\\n      in blood pressure from individual nutrients used supplements rather than foods. Therefore, it\\r\\n      may be important to test nutrients as components of foods and dietary patterns and not as\\r\\n      isolated or processed nutrients.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      DASH, a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial, compared the effects of three dietary\\r\\n      patterns on blood pressure. The study design consisted of a three-week run-in period during\\r\\n      which eligible participants were provided a diet that approximated a typical American diet in\\r\\n      nutrient content. After run-in, eligible participants were randomized to one of three dietary\\r\\n      patterns which lasted for eight weeks: a \\'typical\\' American diet in which the macronutrient\\r\\n      and fiber content reflected current United States consumption and was relatively low in\\r\\n      calcium, potassium, and magnesium; a diet that was high in fruits and vegetables, and\\r\\n      therefore high in potassium, magnesium, and fiber. The macronutrient and calcium content of\\r\\n      this diet otherwise resembled that of the typical American diet. The third diet, termed the\\r\\n      DASH diet, was high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, and had a favorable\\r\\n      macronutrient profile. This diet was low in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol, was\\r\\n      moderately high in protein, and had a high content of calcium, potassium, magnesium, and\\r\\n      fiber. All three diets had about 3 grams of sodium daily--slightly below the average U.S.\\r\\n      consumption-- and all included fresh, frozen, canned, and dried foods. None of the diets was\\r\\n      vegetarian or used specialty foods containing fat substitutes. Alcohol and\\r\\n      caffeine-containing beverages were limited and monitored. Because it was important that good\\r\\n      compliance to the diet be assured, food was provided to the free-living study participants.\\r\\n      The primary endpoint was change in diastolic blood pressure from baseline to the end of the\\r\\n      study. The study compared the changes in diastolic blood pressure among the three dietary\\r\\n      patterns. Screening began in June 1994. Randomization began in September 1994 and was\\r\\n      expected to take two years. Support for the trial ended in July 1997.\\r\\n\\r\\n      NHLBI funded an ancillary study of DASH entitled, Folic Acid Dose Response.

African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, American Indians, and some Asian\\r\\n      Americans and Pacific Islanders are at particularly high risk for type 2 diabetes.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The three strategies tested in ACCORD included the following: (1) Blood sugar - ACCORD was\\r\\n      designed to determine whether lowering blood glucose to a level closer to normal than called\\r\\n      for in current guidelines reduces CVD risk. The study estimated effects on CVD of that level\\r\\n      compared with a level that is usually targeted. (2) Blood pressure - many people with type 2\\r\\n      diabetes have high blood pressure. The blood pressure part of the trial was designed to\\r\\n      determine the effects of lowering blood pressure in the context of good blood sugar control,\\r\\n      that is to determine whether lowering blood pressure to normal (systolic pressure less than\\r\\n      120 mm Hg) will better reduce CVD risk, as compared to a usually-targeted level in current\\r\\n      clinical practice (i.e., below the definition of hypertension; systolic pressure less than\\r\\n      140 mm Hg). (3) Blood Fats - Many people with diabetes have high levels of LDL (\"bad\")\\r\\n      cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as low levels of HDL (\"good\") cholesterol. ACCORD\\r\\n      participants who are selected for this part of the trial were assigned to an intervention to\\r\\n      improve blood fat levels. This part of the study looked at the effects of lowering LDL\\r\\n      cholesterol and blood triglycerides and increasing HDL cholesterol compared to an\\r\\n      intervention that only lowers LDL cholesterol, all in the context of good blood sugar\\r\\n      control. A drug from a class of drugs called \"fibrates\" was used to lower triglycerides and\\r\\n      increase HDL cholesterol, whereas a drug from the class of drugs called \"statins\" was used to\\r\\n      lower LDL cholesterol.\\r\\n\\r\\n      All ACCORD participants received blood sugar treatment from the study. Based on the second\\r\\n      trial (Blood Pressure or Lipid) they were assigned to, participants also received their high\\r\\n      blood pressure or cholesterol care from the study. Study participants received all medication\\r\\n      and treatments related to the study free of charge. Individuals who selected for and\\r\\n      consented to participate in the ACCORD study continued to see their personal physician for\\r\\n      all other health care.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In summary, the ACCORD Study was a double 2x2 factorial design with factors consisting of:\\r\\n      intensive versus standard glycemic control, intensive versus standard blood pressure control,\\r\\n      and blinded fenofibrate or placebo in combination with simvastatin to maintain desirable\\r\\n      LDL-C levels. All 10,251 participants were randomized to the glycemic interventions; a\\r\\n      subgroup of 4,733 participants who met the blood pressure entry criteria were randomized to\\r\\n      the blood pressure interventions in one 2x2 trial; and a distinct subgroup of 5,518\\r\\n      participants who met the lipid entry criteria were randomized to the lipid interventions in\\r\\n      the second 2x2 trial. All participants had established type 2 diabetes and were recruited\\r\\n      from 77 clinical centers in the United States (64 sites) and Canada (13 sites).\\r\\n\\r\\n      On February 6, 2008, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) announced that\\r\\n      participants in the intensive glycemia treatment would be transitioned to the ACCORD standard\\r\\n      glycemic treatment approach due to higher mortality in the intensive treatment group\\r\\n      terminating the experimental arm of the Glycemia Trial early. The Blood Pressure and Lipid\\r\\n      trials continued as designed to their planned termination in 2009.\\r\\n    Niacin67 Years30 YearsMale',\n",

Conventional therapy consists of intravenous heparin followed\\r\\n      by oral anticoagulants usually given for three to six months. The recommended intensity of\\r\\n      oral anticoagulants (warfarin) has been derived from clinical trials. Such therapy is usually\\r\\n      quite effective. However, some patients develop recurrent disease after the oral\\r\\n      anticoagulants are stopped. A recent randomized study evaluated the optimal duration of oral\\r\\n      anticoagulant therapy. After acute treatment with heparin, subjects were treated with oral\\r\\n      anticoagulants for either six weeks or six months with a target INR * of 2 to 2.85. There was\\r\\n      no difference in mortality in the two groups. Recurrence was not seen while the patients were\\r\\n      under treatment. When anticoagulants were stopped, recurrent thrombosis was documented in 18\\r\\n      percent of the patients treated for six weeks and in 9.5 percent of those treated for six\\r\\n      months. The period of greatest risk of recurrence for the six weeks patients was immediately\\r\\n      after therapy was stopped. There was a linear increase in cumulative risk of 5 to 6 percent\\r\\n      per year for both treatment groups during the following 18 months.\\r\\n\\r\\n      For patients who have experienced idiopathic venous thrombosis, the risk of recurrence may\\r\\n      continue even after several months of conventional therapy. Further prophylactic therapy\\r\\n      might be beneficial for the patients who are at risk for late recurrence. But, because of the\\r\\n      presumed risk of bleeding and inconvenience of monitoring standard warfarin therapy, most\\r\\n      physicians usually limit treatment to three to six months.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In 1997, Simioni showed a cumulative recurrence rate of VTE of 39.7 percent among those with\\r\\n      factor V Leiden mutation, with all recurrences occurring within three years, a rate 2.4 times\\r\\n      higher than among individuals without the mutation. The factor V Leiden mutation is found in\\r\\n      4 to 6 percent of Caucasians and is the single most important cause of thromboembolism in a\\r\\n      variety of conditions. Heterozygous carriers with the mutation have VTE at a younger age than\\r\\n      do noncarriers. Among those with first VTE, the prevalence of the mutation is 15 to 40\\r\\n      percent and among those with a family history of VTE, as high as 50 percent. However, in a\\r\\n      large study of men participating in the Physicians Health Study, those individuals with the\\r\\n      mutation had an increased rate of VTE over time. These age-specific incidence rate\\r\\n      differences ranged from 1.23 to 5.97 in those aged 70 or older. These data suggest that\\r\\n      confounders other than genetic predisposition are important in the development of VTE.\\r\\n\\r\\n      * The INR or international normalized ratio is the ratio of patient prothrombin to control\\r\\n      prothrombin multiplied by the international sensitivity index. The INR was introduced by the\\r\\n      World Health Organization to standardize control of anticoagulant therapy internationally.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled.

The disease is characterized by severe anemia beginning in the first 6\\r\\n      to 12 months of life. If untreated, the life expectancy is less than 5 years of age. Chronic\\r\\n      red blood cell transfusions to maintain hemoglobin levels between 9 and 11 gm/dl\\r\\n      (\"hypertransfusion\") alleviate the anemia and partially suppress erythropoiesis. The regular\\r\\n      administration of red blood cells also improves growth, delays or prevents enlargement of the\\r\\n      liver and spleen, and prevents the development of bone abnormalities that cause fractures as\\r\\n      well as disfiguring changes known as Cooley\\'s facies. Transfusions carry risks of\\r\\n      alloimmunization, iron overload, and blood-transmitted infections. In the absence of\\r\\n      effective iron chelation therapy, iron overload leads to numerous complications, including\\r\\n      delayed or absent sexual development, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, cardiac arrhythmias, and\\r\\n      congestive heart failure. Nonchelated or poorly chelated patients usually die of heart\\r\\n      disease by 20 to 30 years of age.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The addition of chelation therapy with deferoxamine (DFO) to the treatment of Cooley\\'s anemia\\r\\n      has dramatically improved the outcome for affected patients. With regular chelation therapy,\\r\\n      the accumulation of excessive iron can be prevented. Studies have demonstrated that\\r\\n      well-chelated patients have normal or only modest increases in liver iron, improved growth,\\r\\n      sexual development, and most importantly, a markedly reduced chance of developing\\r\\n      iron-induced heart disease.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the past few years, several new approaches to the treatment of thalassemia have included\\r\\n      marrow or stem cell transplantation; the use of young red blood cells (\"neocytes\") for\\r\\n      transfusion; maintenance of a higher pretransfusion hemoglobin level; new iron chelators; and\\r\\n      the use of drugs such as hydroxyurea, erythropoietin, and butyrate compounds.\\r\\n\\r\\n      It is recognized that even with a clinical network, the number of patients with Cooley\\'s\\r\\n      anemia who can be enrolled in a research protocol is likely to be small. Therefore, although\\r\\n      a randomized clinical trial may be the preferred way of assessing the clinical benefits of a\\r\\n      new therapy, it may not be feasible in some instances, even using biomarkers or other\\r\\n      surrogate outcome measures. Depending upon the specific questions being addressed, other\\r\\n      study designs might be appropriate. These might include pre- and post-treatment assessment or\\r\\n      historical control studies. In all cases, the proposed design, including sample size, would\\r\\n      be evaluated by the Protocol Review Committee.\\r\\n\\r\\n      There is an urgent need to evaluate new and existing therapeutic approaches for persons with\\r\\n      thalassemia and to disseminate the findings to health care professionals, patients, and the\\r\\n      public. There are several reasons why a thalassemia clinical research network will accelerate\\r\\n      clinical research and meet this need. The highly variable and sometimes complicated clinical\\r\\n      manifestations of thalassemia often make it difficult to accumulate a large number of\\r\\n      comparable patients in one center. Furthermore, uniformity in treatment protocols may reduce\\r\\n      the number of patients needed at each clinical center. Also, the TCRN mechanism will help\\r\\n      pool the necessary clinical expertise and administrative resources to facilitate the conduct\\r\\n      of multiple and novel therapeutic trials in a timely, efficient manner. This, in turn, would\\r\\n      promote rapid dissemination of research findings to health care professionals.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The network was originally funded in 2000 and has been extended through June 2010 to perform\\r\\n      interventional clinical trials in key areas of thalassemia care. Two major trials are\\r\\n      proposed: First, a randomized, controlled trial to examine the effect of DFO alone versus DFO\\r\\n      plus deferiprone on cardiac disease due to transfusional iron overload; second, a randomized\\r\\n      trial of arginine versus sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension, an important problem in\\r\\n      thalassemia intermedia and other hemolytic states. Goals are to provide an infrastructure for\\r\\n      development, launch, and prompt completion of small, innovative trials in thalassemia and to\\r\\n      improve assessment of phenotype and clinical outcomes in thalassemia to facilitate current\\r\\n      and future clinical trials. This will be accomplished by two studies: The Thalassemia\\r\\n      Longitudinal Cohort (TLC) study and the Iron Burden Study, which is a detailed study of\\r\\n      iron-related organ damage comparing measures of iron burden in the heart, liver, and pancreas\\r\\n      to outcomes of iron-related organ dysfunction. Combined with the clinical trials and the\\r\\n      ability to perform detailed genotype/phenotype correlations, these improved phenotype and\\r\\n      outcome measures are powerful tools to enhance knowledge about thalassemia clinical care.\\r\\n      Please refer to individual Clinicaltrials.gov study listings for TCRN study specifics and\\r\\n      current information about trials, eligibility, and site participation.

(Cholesterol-Lowering Agent Trial).\\r\\n\\r\\n        Men and women with angiographically-documented coronary heart disease (Fish Oil Tr\\r\\n      \\n      BACKGROUND:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes chronic bronchitis and\\r\\n      emphysema, affects more than 16 million Americans, is the fourth leading cause of death in\\r\\n      the USA, and costs the nation billions in direct and indirect health care costs. Though only\\r\\n      about two million of the 16 million people with COPD have emphysema, emphysema is more\\r\\n      disabling, accounting for approximately half of the 114 million days of restricted activity\\r\\n      and half of the 53 million days of disability attributed to COPD per year. Emphysema is\\r\\n      characterized by destruction of the air space walls, leading anatomically to abnormal,\\r\\n      persistent enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, and without\\r\\n      obvious fibrosis. The clinical result is continuous dyspnea due to hyperinflation of the\\r\\n      lung, over distention of the chest wall, disadvantaged respiratory muscles, and hypoxia, even\\r\\n      at rest.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Treatment options in emphysema are limited and primarily aimed at symptomatic relief of the\\r\\n      dyspnea by maximizing the depleted reserves of the patient. In the late stages, care is\\r\\n      supportive, in the form of oxygen therapy, bronchodilator, nutritional supplementation and\\r\\n      exercise rehabilitation. Exercise rehabilitation has been shown to improve the quality of\\r\\n      life, but only oxygen therapy has been shown to affect survival. For patients less than 60\\r\\n      years old, lung transplantation may be possible, but scarcity of donor lungs and expense\\r\\n      greatly limits this option and the efficacy has not been studied. Lung volume reduction\\r\\n      surgery is currently under investigation for its effect on symptoms and survival. For the few\\r\\n      patients with hereditary alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, the recent report of the NHLBI\\r\\n      supported Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency Registry Study Group cautions that although those\\r\\n      with moderate airflow obstruction may benefit from augmentation therapy, more studies were\\r\\n      needed to draw firm conclusions and to answer questions about dose and dosing schedules.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Recent laboratory data have shown that all-trans-retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A,\\r\\n      can regenerate alveoli in adult rats with elastase induced emphysema (Massaro, GD and Massaro\\r\\n      D. Retinoic Acid Treatment Abrogates Elastase-induced Pulmonary Emphysema in Rats. Nature Med\\r\\n      3:675-677, 1997). Based upon the findings that prior to septation, rats have fibroblasts rich\\r\\n      in vitamin A storage granules, high concentrations of cellular retinol binding protein, and\\r\\n      lung nuclear retinoic acid binding receptors, all of which diminish after septation and the\\r\\n      fact that retinoic acid increases the number of alveoli in rats, the investigators reasoned\\r\\n      that retinoic acid plays a key role in septation. Tracheal instillation of elastase into\\r\\n      adult rats resulted in an increase in lung volume, a decrease in surface area, and large\\r\\n      alveoli as in human emphysema. Intra peritoneal injection of all-trans retinoic acid in the\\r\\n      elastase-treated rats for 12 days prior to sacrifice reduced the lung volume and increased\\r\\n      the surface area to normal.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In addition to the elastase-treated rats, all trans-retinoic acid has been found to induce\\r\\n      formation of alveoli in normal rats, in neonatal rats treated with dexamethasone, which\\r\\n      prevents septation, in adult tight skin mice, and in fetal mouse lung in culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n      These findings led to interest in the medical community whether adult emphysema patients\\r\\n      might get symptomatic relief from treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid. In September 1998,\\r\\n      the NHLBI convened a workshop, entitled \"Clinical Trial Feasibility: All-trans-Retinoic Acid\\r\\n      for the Treatment of Emphysema\", to discuss the feasibility of a clinical trial to test the\\r\\n      efficacy of retinoic acid in the treatment of emphysema. The workshop participants agreed\\r\\n      that the laboratory findings were exciting, but that a proof of principle study was needed to\\r\\n      demonstrate whether the laboratory findings could be applied to humans with emphysema. Since\\r\\n      there was adequate information about the dose range and toxicity of retinoids in humans,\\r\\n      adequate methods for assessing the extent of emphysema, and adequate methods to assess the\\r\\n      biological activity and distribution of retinoids in the human lung, the workshop\\r\\n      participants thought studies in emphysema patients were possible and appropriate. Several\\r\\n      possible populations and retinoids, especially the retinoic acids, were discussed as\\r\\n      appropriate for a clinical trial. However, the participants did not think that there was\\r\\n      sufficient information available to recommend a single trial design and recommended the\\r\\n      conduct of multiple small trials, allowing flexibility in the choice of population, retinoid,\\r\\n      doses, and outcomes.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The core study is a multi-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical\\r\\n      trial enrolling a total of 300 non-smoking persons with emphysema at 5 participating clinical\\r\\n      centers. Study participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three retinoid\\r\\n      treatment arms. Within each study arm, participants were randomized to active treatment or to\\r\\n      a matched placebo in a 3:1 ratio.

In 1993, 4.7 million Americans carried the diagnosis of CHF, and about\\r\\n      400,000 new cases are diagnosed every year. It is estimated that there are 800,000 to 1.2\\r\\n      million CHF patients with NYHA class III-IV symptoms. The diagnosis and treatment of CHF and\\r\\n      its episodes of decompensation can be facilitated by pulmonary artery catheter use, but its\\r\\n      efficacy is highly dependent on the physician\\'s experience in the treatment of such patients.\\r\\n      Recently, concern has been raised about the benefits of PAC, also known as Swan-Ganz\\r\\n      catheterization.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In response to concerns about the benefits and safety of PAC, the NHLBI and the Food and Drug\\r\\n      Administration (FDA) co-sponsored a workshop in August 1997 entitiled \"Pulmonary Artery\\r\\n      Catheterization and Clinical Outcomes (PACCO)\". The purpose of the workshop was to provide an\\r\\n      objective assessment of the state-of-the-science of PAC and its various uses. Experts in\\r\\n      critical care, pulmonary medicine, cardiovascular medicine, surgery, pediatric cardiology,\\r\\n      nursing, biostatistics, ethics, and medical economics identified several important clinical\\r\\n      areas as priorities for clinical trials; persistent/refractory congestive heart failure (NYHA\\r\\n      class IV) received top priority to test whether a PAC-directed treatment strategy achieves a\\r\\n      better and less costly long-term outcome compared to a non-invasive treatment strategy. In\\r\\n      addition to providing data on outcome, hospital utilization, and costs, the study would have\\r\\n      additional benefits. For example, it would provide a clear benchmark for testing other\\r\\n      technologies, now in developmental stages, that could supplant PAC in the future. Finally,\\r\\n      the study would provide the basis for developing competency requirements for physicians,\\r\\n      nurses, and others who insert and use pulmonary artery catheters, which was a strong\\r\\n      recommendation of the PACCO Workshop.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Patients were randomized into two treatment arms: A total of 218 patients were assigned into\\r\\n      a treatment strategy without PAC hemodynamic monitoring (Usual Group) and 215 patients into a\\r\\n      treatment strategy guided by PAC (Hemodynamic Group). The primary endpoint was the combined\\r\\n      endpoint of rehospitalization and death.\\r\\n\\r\\n      For all patients randomized, therapy was tailored to the ultimate goal of discharge on an\\r\\n      oral medical regimen to provide better relief of CHF symptoms, to reduce filling pressures\\r\\n      and to maintain adequate perfusion. These goals were the same for both groups, but in the\\r\\n      Usual Group therapy was adjusted according to clinical assessment alone, while in the\\r\\n      PAC-directed group, actual measurement of hemodynamics was used to supplement clinical\\r\\n      assessment. The oral medical regimen for discharge was designed by the attending heart\\r\\n      failure physician based on the standard available medications of angiotensin converting\\r\\n      enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), nitrates, hydralazine, furosemide and other diuretic agents.\\r\\n      Intravenous diuretics were used when major diuresis was desired with subsequent change to\\r\\n      oral diuretics at least 48 hours before discharge. Physicians could also use low dose\\r\\n      infusions of dopamine or dobutamine to facilitate diuresis. Intravenous nitroprusside could\\r\\n      be used in either group.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the Usual Group, therapy was tailored to the following goals: a) absence of evidence of\\r\\n      elevated intracardiac filling pressures; relief of orthopnea; relief of abdominal discomfort\\r\\n      attributed to hepatosplenchnic congestion; resolution of peripheral edema, ascites, and\\r\\n      rales; reduction of jugular venous distension to 5 cm or less above sternal angle; and b)\\r\\n      adequate peripheral perfusion; warm extremities, if they could be achieved, and pulse\\r\\n      pressure 25 percent or more , or, if less, the greatest which could be achieved. Either\\r\\n      during or after hemodynamic monitoring, therapy could be adjusted to achieve the clinical\\r\\n      goals above and further adjusted, if necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure and renal\\r\\n      function for all patients. Patients for whom therapy was adjusted without hemodynamic\\r\\n      monitoring could crossover for hemodynamic monitoring at any time they reached certain\\r\\n      criteria. The criteria for crossover included: need to add intravenous inotropic agents above\\r\\n      3 mcg/kg/minute to prevent symptomatic hypotension; repeated inability to discontinue\\r\\n      low-dose inotropic agents; or renal insufficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the PAC-directed hemodynamic arm, therapy was adjusted to achieve specific hemodynamic\\r\\n      goals in addition to the clinical goals in the Usual Group. These goals could include:\\r\\n      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) 15 mm Hg or less; right atrial pressure 8mm Hg or\\r\\n      less unless PCWP is 15 mm Hg or less; maintenance of systolic blood pressure of 80 or above,\\r\\n      except for occasional transient decreases to lower levels after oral medications.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Regardless of the goals by which therapy was adjusted in the hospital, the following\\r\\n      conditions were met prior to discharge: 24 hours on oral medications alone without major\\r\\n      medication change except for anticoagulation, and 48 hours after discontinuation of any\\r\\n      intravenous inotropic medications; stable fluid balance; patient education; and home services\\r\\n      and follow-up appointment.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Post-discharge management was the same for both groups, according to standard practice.\\r\\n      Patients were followed for adjustment of CHF medications in their heart failure clinics at\\r\\n      one to two weeks, four weeks, three months, and six months and more often if clinically\\r\\n      indicated. There was a minimum of six months of follow-up.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Data collection included: blood pressure and weight at each visit; electrocardiogram at\\r\\n      pre-randomization visit and at each hospitalization; serum electrolytes; echocardiogram at\\r\\n      randomization, at hospitalization discharge, and at six month follow-up; exercise stress\\r\\n      tests during index hospitalization and six month follow-up; natriuretic hormone profile at\\r\\n      randomization, discharge, and six month follow-up; medical history, endpoints, side effects,\\r\\n      hospitalizations and quality of life; and compliance with protocol.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The study consisted of a Clinical Coordinating Center which included a network of 26 clinical\\r\\n      units, and an echocardiographic core laboratory.

Although Hispanic women also exhibit high prevalence\\r\\n      of obesity, mortality from heart disease is less than for Black or white women and mortality\\r\\n      from diabetes is less than for Black women.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The increased prevalence of obesity in Black females is present during childhood, and the\\r\\n      prevalence of obesity is increasing faster in Black girls than in white girls. Recent data\\r\\n      from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) showed that\\r\\n      during preadolescence, age 6-11 years, 30.7 percent of Black girls, compared with 22.0\\r\\n      percent of white girls, were overweight. Furthermore, over the past 30 years the prevalence\\r\\n      of obesity in this preadolescent age group has increased 150 percent in Black girls compared\\r\\n      with 40 percent in white girls. The prevalence of obesity in the adolescent age of 12 to 17\\r\\n      years is similarly high, at 29.9 percent in Black girls compared with 20.7 percent in white\\r\\n      girls. The 35 percent increase in obesity over the past 30 years is similar in the\\r\\n      preadolescent and adolescent age groups for white girls, but for Black girls the increase is\\r\\n      greater in the younger age group (150 percent more prevalent) than in the older age group (80\\r\\n      percent increase) .\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Special Emphasis Panel (SEP) on Intervention Studies in Children and Adolescents to\\r\\n      Prevent Cardiovascular Disease was convened in September 1997 to review the efficacy and\\r\\n      effectiveness of interventions to prevent and improve known cardiovascular disease risk\\r\\n      factors in children and adolescents and to develop recommendations for future preventive\\r\\n      intervention studies. The initiative was developed in response to recommendations of the SEP.\\r\\n      The RFA was released in April 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Girl\\'s health Enrichment Multi-site Studies (GEMS) is a collection of studies designed to\\r\\n      develop and test interventions to prevent excessive weight gain by African-American girls as\\r\\n      they enter and proceed through puberty. The research is being conducted as four\\r\\n      inter-dependent, clinical trials. They are \"inter-dependent\" in the sense that they are\\r\\n      considering similar study populations, following similar follow-up schedules and use a \"core\"\\r\\n      set of evaluation procedures. Nonetheless, GEMS is not a \"multi-center clinical trial\" in the\\r\\n      usual sense - each field center is evaluating its own intervention (and corresponding\\r\\n      control). As a result, each study will have high internal validity and will be designed and\\r\\n      analyzed as a study in its own right.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In Phase I, several distinct and separate interventions were developed. Interventions\\r\\n      addressed diet, physical activity, and psychosocial and familial influences. There were four\\r\\n      participating centers in Phase I, including the University of Memphis, Stanford University,\\r\\n      the University of Minnesota, and Baylor College of Medicine. The coordinating center was\\r\\n      located at George Washington University.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In Phase II, individual clinical trials will be supported to test the efficacy of\\r\\n      interventions developed in Phase I. Although the interventions developed by each field center\\r\\n      will be unique, the centers will collaborate to standardize key measurements, outcomes, and\\r\\n      main analysis methods.

Because the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke increases with increasing blood\\r\\n      pressure throughout the entire range of blood pressure levels, people with blood pressure\\r\\n      above the optimal level of 120/80 are at increased risk of disease. Approximately 48 percent\\r\\n      of the adult population have blood pressure either normal but above optimal levels or have\\r\\n      Stage 1 hypertension, a prevalence which increases with age.

In addition, the population studied across\\r\\n      four geographic areas, encompassing individuals with diastolic blood pressure between 80-95\\r\\n      mm Hg and systolic blood pressure <160 mm Hg, was broadly representative, thus making the\\r\\n      results generalizable to a large portion of the United States population.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The effects on blood pressure of three levels of sodium intake and two dietary patterns were\\r\\n      compared. The combined impact of sodium reduction with dietary intervention was evaluated as\\r\\n      a potential non-pharmacologic treatment alternative to drug therapy for stage one\\r\\n      hypertension or for maintaining normal blood pressure levels. The two dietary patterns were a\\r\\n      control diet that represented the typical American diet and an intervention diet (DASH diet)\\r\\n      that was high in fruits, vegetables, included whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts, and\\r\\n      reduced in fats, red meat, sweets, and sugar-containing beverages and dairy products. The\\r\\n      three levels of sodium were higher (current United States intake), intermediate (current\\r\\n      recommended levels), and lower (potentially optimal levels). Participants were assigned to\\r\\n      one of the two dietary patterns using a parallel group design and were fed at each sodium\\r\\n      level using a randomized cross-over design.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Three eligibility pre-screening visits were followed by a two-week run-in feeding period and\\r\\n      then a four-week intervention period at each of three sodium levels. During the run-in for\\r\\n      the intervention feeding periods, all food was provided to participants. They were required\\r\\n      to attend the clinic for at least one meal per day, five days per week, and to take home food\\r\\n      to eat for other meals. Each of the four clinics recruited 100 participants. Blood pressure\\r\\n      was measured once a week during the first of three weeks and five times during the last week.\\r\\n      During the final feeding period, fasting blood was collected and 24-hour urine collections\\r\\n      were analyzed for magnesium, potassium. calcium, sodium, and creatinine.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DASH - Sodium determined, separately by race, gender, and hypertension status: 1) the effects\\r\\n      on blood pressure of three levels of dietary sodium within the context of both a control diet\\r\\n      and the DASH diet; 2) the effect on blood pressure of the DASH diet, relative to the control\\r\\n      diet, at each of the three levels of sodium intake. The study also assessed whether the\\r\\n      effect on blood pressure of going from higher to lower sodium diets differs for participants\\r\\n      in the control and DASH diets. Lastly, the study determined whether the blood pressure effect\\r\\n      associated with reducing sodium from the higher to the intermediate level differs from the\\r\\n      blood pressure effect associated with reducing sodium from the intermediate to the lower\\r\\n      level, that is, testing whether the blood pressure effects of sodium are linear across sodium\\r\\n      levels for each diet.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Recruitment and screening began in August 1997. The first cohort began the experimental diets\\r\\n      in January 1998 and the last cohort completed the diets in November 1999. A total of 412\\r\\n      participants were enrolled into the study.

This was especially the case for studies of chronic diseases and their prevention in\\r\\n      mature women. These conditions (coronary heart disease, cancer, and osteoporosis) are the\\r\\n      leading causes of impairment of quality of life, morbidity, and mortality in post-menopausal\\r\\n      United States women. The WHI, mandated by Congress, was established in 1991 by the National\\r\\n      Institutes of Health and located in the Office of the Director (OD). The Clinical\\r\\n      Coordinating Center for the clinical trial/observational study was funded in September 1992\\r\\n      and the 16 Vanguard Clinical Centers were funded in March 1993. The initial protocol was\\r\\n      developed jointly by the Clinical Coordinating Center and the Program Office and was reviewed\\r\\n      and approved by the Investigators Committee on April 20, 1993. Additional clinical centers\\r\\n      were funded in 1994.\\r\\n\\r\\n      On October 1, 1997, administration of the WHI was transferred to the NHLBI where it is\\r\\n      conducted as a consortium effort led by the NHLBI in cooperation with the National Institute\\r\\n      of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), the National Cancer Institute\\r\\n      (NCI), and the National Institute on Aging (NIA).\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      As has been described in the objective, the WHI has three major components: a randomized\\r\\n      controlled clinical trial, an observational study, and a study of community approaches to\\r\\n      developing healthful behaviors. Recruitment for the WHI began in September 1993 and ended in\\r\\n      December 1998. Six clinical centers completed recruitment in January 1997. The remaining 34\\r\\n      centers completed recruitment in December 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\n      CLINICAL TRIAL COMPONENT\\r\\n\\r\\n      The clinical trial component consists of three subtrials: the hormone replacement trial, the\\r\\n      dietary modification trial, and the calcium /vitamin D supplementation trial. Approximately\\r\\n      27,500 women aged 50 to 79 are participating in the HRT, which tests whether long-term HRT\\r\\n      reduces coronary heart disease and fractures without increasing breast cancer risk. Women\\r\\n      with a uterus were randomized to receive either estrogen plus progestin or a placebo.\\r\\n      Progestin was added to protect women with a uterus from endometrial cancer. Women who have\\r\\n      had a hysterectomy were randomized to receive either estrogen alone or a placebo. The\\r\\n      estrogen plus progestin trial was stopped early on July 8, 2002 after an average follow-up of\\r\\n      5.2 years on the recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. The estrogen alone\\r\\n      study continued unchanged until March 2, 2004 when the NIH instructed participants to stop\\r\\n      taking their study pills and to begin the follow-up phase of the study. . Participants in the\\r\\n      estrogen alone study will be followed for eight to 12 years and have clinic visits every six\\r\\n      months to assure safety and assess their health.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The dietary modification trial component studies the effect of a low-fat, high fruit,\\r\\n      vegetable and grain diet on breast cancer, colorectal cancer and heart disease in 48,000\\r\\n      postmenopausal women. Participants are randomized to a comparison group which maintains usual\\r\\n      dietary habits or to a dietary change group. Women in the dietary change group decrease their\\r\\n      fat intake to 20 percent of total daily calories, increase fruit and vegetable consumption to\\r\\n      five or more servings per day, and increase grains to six or more servings per day.\\r\\n      Additionally, they monitor their food intake and attend nutrition group meetings to learn\\r\\n      more about changing their diets in the first year. Thereafter they attend four meetings per\\r\\n      year.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The calcium/vitamin D supplementation subtrial tests whether calcium and vitamin D\\r\\n      supplements reduce the risk of hip and other fractures and colorectal cancer in\\r\\n      postmenopausal women. Women in the hormone replacement therapy and the dietary modification\\r\\n      trials are encouraged to join the calcium/vitamin D supplementation study. Approximately\\r\\n      45,000 postmenopausal women are randomized into one of two study groups. One group was\\r\\n      randomly assigned to receive 1,000 mg of elemental calcium (as calcium carbonate) and 400\\r\\n      International Units of vitamin D₃daily. The second group received a matching placebo.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Women already taking calcium supplements can continue to take them. Participants will be\\r\\n      followed for eight to 11 years and contacted by their clinical center every six months to\\r\\n      assure their safety and assess their health.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Total number of trial participants in all three subtrials is 68,135.\\r\\n\\r\\n      OBSERVATIONAL STUDY\\r\\n\\r\\n      The several goals of the study include: to give reliable estimates of extent to which known\\r\\n      risk factors predict heart disease, cancers, and fractures; to identify new risk factors for\\r\\n      these and other diseases in women; to compare risk factors, presence of disease at the start\\r\\n      of the study and new occurrences of disease during the WHI in all study components; and to\\r\\n      create a future resource to identify biological indicators of disease, especially substances\\r\\n      and factors found in blood. The study enrolled 93,726 postmenopausal women and will track\\r\\n      them for an average of nine years. Participants fill out periodic health forms and visit the\\r\\n      clinic three years after enrollment. They take no medication and do not change their health\\r\\n      habits.\\r\\n\\r\\n      COMMUNITY PREVENTION STUDY\\r\\n\\r\\n      The community prevention study consists of 12 separate studies conducted at eight of the\\r\\n      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) University-based Prevention Research\\r\\n      Centers through a cooperative agreement between NIH and CDC. The 12 studies began in October\\r\\n      1995 and continue for an additional five years. The collaboration supports health promotion\\r\\n      and disease prevention research and demonstration projects that are community-based and focus\\r\\n      on healthy behaviors that prevent the major causes of death and disability and that promote\\r\\n      health practices that lead to more effective public health interventions. Each project\\r\\n      provides research dissemination and translation of findings into community interventions.\\r\\n      Topics under study include: attitudes towards hysterectomy, oophorectomy, and surgical\\r\\n      menopause among African Americans; reducing cardiovascular disease risk among Black women;\\r\\n      environmental and policy interventions to increase physical activity among minority women\\r\\n      ages 40 to 75; peer support intervention for cardiovascular disease risk among African\\r\\n      American women, aged 40 and older; assessing the effectiveness of a brief medical-provider\\r\\n      educational intervention for osteoporosis in minority women aged 40 and older; improving the\\r\\n      delivery of diabetes care to women in minority groups; and assessment of moderate physical\\r\\n      activity among women.\\r\\n    Fluconazole65 Years18 YearsAll\",\n",

Large randomized trials have demonstrated that\\r\\n      aggressive reperfusion strategies in conjunction with aspirin can reduce mortality in\\r\\n      patients with suspected acute MI to an average of 6.5 to 7.5 percent. However, the mortality\\r\\n      rate remains high in two particular subgroups of patients: those who do not receive\\r\\n      thrombolysis (11.5 to 13 percent) or those over 65 years who do receive thrombolytics (13.5\\r\\n      to 24 percent).\\r\\n\\r\\n      Recently, attention has turned to additional adjunctive pharmacologic treatment with agents\\r\\n      such as magnesium, nitrates, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to determine their\\r\\n      potential for reducing mortality further. Of these, magnesium appears to be particularly\\r\\n      promising. It is safe, even in the hands of physicians who have no prior experience with it\\r\\n      and it is easily administered and readily available in any hospital in the United States.\\r\\n      Further, if it has the expected benefit in the high risk groups described, it would become an\\r\\n      unusually cost-effective intervention, costing less than $2,500 per year of life saved.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Supplemental administration of magnesium very early after the onset of acute myocardial\\r\\n      infarction is supported by abundant data indicating potential cardioprotective effects of\\r\\n      magnesium. Magnesium is considered to be \"nature\\'s physiologic calcium blocker.\" This is\\r\\n      because it protects myocytes against calcium overload by inhibiting calcium influx which is\\r\\n      particularly important at the time of reperfusion. In experimental models of ischemia and\\r\\n      reperfusion, agents inhibiting calcium influx improved post-ischemic recovery of mechanical\\r\\n      function when given prior to or at the time of reperfusion. On the other hand, little\\r\\n      improvement in mechanical function was observed if such agents were given 15-20 minutes after\\r\\n      the onset of reperfusion. Reduced serum magnesium may also be responsible for a maladaptive\\r\\n      increase in coronary tone and an increased response to vasoconstrictors.\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, when increased serum magnesium might be\\r\\n      beneficial, there is actually a decline in free magnesium. This comes about because of a\\r\\n      sharp rise in free fatty acids brought about by catecholamine induced lipolysis at the onset\\r\\n      of chest pain, that results in a completing of magnesium in the form of insoluble soaps.\\r\\n      Thus, although total body magnesium does not decrease, magnesium available in a free form\\r\\n      that is capable of exerting a cardioprotective effect declines. Hence, there is a strong\\r\\n      theoretical rationale for supplemental magnesium administration in this setting.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Since 1984, at least 10 randomized control trials (RCTs) of intravenous magnesium for acute\\r\\n      MI have been reported. Several statistical models exist for pooling the data from multiple\\r\\n      RCTs in a meta-analysis and estimating the treatment effect of magnesium. It is important to\\r\\n      review the essential features of these models in order to place the RCT findings in proper\\r\\n      perspective. The fixed effects model assumes that the RCTs are sampled from a homogenous\\r\\n      group of trials. Under the homogeneity assumption, each RCT provides an estimate of the true\\r\\n      treatment effect and differences between the estimates from the various RCTs are due only to\\r\\n      experimental error (within-trial variability). The random effects model assumes the RCTs are\\r\\n      heterogeneous and that differences between their estimates of the treatment effect are due\\r\\n      both to experimental error (within-trial variability) and real differences among the trials\\r\\n      such as trial design and characteristics of the patients enrolled (between-trial\\r\\n      variability). The random effects model is generally favored since heterogeneity that cannot\\r\\n      be explained by experimental error often exists among the RCTs, and this model takes such\\r\\n      heterogeneity into account in estimation and hypothesis testing. Meta-analyses of the seven\\r\\n      RCTs published between 1984-199l provided an estimated odds ratio (OR) for mortality of\\r\\n      magnesium treated patients of 0.44 (0.27-0.71) using the fixed effects model and 0.45\\r\\n      (0.23-0.86) using the random effects model. The Leicester Intravenous Magnesium Intervention\\r\\n      Trial (LIMIT-2), published in 1992, reported a 24 percent reduction in mortality with\\r\\n      magnesium treatment (P<0.04), confirming the benefit of magnesium in reducing mortality in MI\\r\\n      and inspiring many clinicians to advocate magnesium treatment programs in their coronary care\\r\\n      units. The magnesium treated patients in LIMIT-2 experienced a 25 percent lower incidence of\\r\\n      congestive heart failure in the coronary care unit, suggesting that magnesium exerts its\\r\\n      beneficial effects, at least in part, via a direct protective action on the myocardium. Given\\r\\n      the potent predictive power of left ventricular function on survival following MI one would\\r\\n      anticipate that magnesium-treated patients in LIMIT-2 would have a lower long-term mortality.\\r\\n      This hypothesis appears to have been confirmed by the recent long-term follow up report from\\r\\n      LIMIT-2 showing a 21percent lower rate of ischemic heart disease related mortality in the\\r\\n      magnesium group over a median follow up of 2.7 years. The LIMIT-2 investigators have recently\\r\\n      examined the mortality rates over a five year follow up, and continue to document the same\\r\\n      long term benefit of magnesium administered in the acute phase of infarction. The absence of\\r\\n      any loss of the mortality benefit of magnesium over the long term is consistent with a\\r\\n      significant myocardial protective effect achieved during the critical period of myocardial\\r\\n      reperfusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The results of ISIS-4 seemed to contradict the results of the above studies. A total of\\r\\n      58,043 patients were enrolled in ISIS-4, 29,009 allocated to magnesium and 29,034 to control.\\r\\n      There were 2,196 deaths (7.6 percent) by 35 days in the magnesium group and 2,079 deaths (7.2\\r\\n      percent) in the control group (OR 1.06[0.99-1.13]) suggesting no mortality benefit of\\r\\n      magnesium administration and even the possibility of slight harm. The findings of ISIS-4 have\\r\\n      triggered considerable controversy over the reasons why it produced a null effect for\\r\\n      magnesium in reducing mortality in suspected acute MI.\\r\\n\\r\\n      When ISIS-4 is added to the preceding eight RCTs, the fixed effects model (driven heavily by\\r\\n      the large sample size of ISIS-4) indicates no beneficial effect of magnesium (OR= 1.02\\r\\n      [0.96-1.09]) while the random effects model that takes into account the heterogeneity among\\r\\n      these trials suggests that magnesium may reduce mortality (OR= 0.69[0.47-1.02]). Thus, the\\r\\n      random effects model suggests that one must search for possible sources of differences\\r\\n      between ISIS-4 and the preceding trials. Two important differences that appear to be acting\\r\\n      in concert to bias ISIS 4 towards a null effect of magnesium include:\\r\\n\\r\\n      1 . A low control group mortality rate. The control group mortality in ISIS-4 was only 7.2\\r\\n      percent. This was probably the result of the combination of extensive use of thrombolysis (70\\r\\n      percent of patients) and antiplatelet agents (94 percent of patients) combined with the\\r\\n      enrollment of intrinsically low-risk patients (only 28 percent were over 70 years of age, 17\\r\\n      percent had a history of a prior MI, 14 percent had clinical congestive heart failure (CHF),\\r\\n      and 2 percent had systolic blood pressure (SBP) <100 mm Hg). Incremental mortality reducing\\r\\n      effects of magnesium are difficult to detect against a low background control mortality rate.\\r\\n      The inability of ISIS 4 to detect any overall benefit of magnesium also apply to specific\\r\\n      subgroups such as the 17,325 patients who did not receive thrombolytics. ISIS 4 had less than\\r\\n      60 percent power to detect even a 10 percent reduction observed in the 9.3 percent control\\r\\n      mortality in this subgroup. A detailed analysis relating the mortality rate in the control\\r\\n      group and the treatment effect of magnesium observed in the clinical trials published before\\r\\n      ISIS-4 shows clearly that the benefit of magnesium therapy increases as the control group\\r\\n      mortality increases. Using this relationship, it was predicted that trials with a control\\r\\n      group mortality rate of about 7 percent would show no benefit of magnesium therapy, precisely\\r\\n      the result observed in ISIS-4. Of note, the LIMIT-2 trial observed a control group mortality\\r\\n      of 10.3 percent that was reduced to 7.8 percent with magnesium. The ISIS-4 control group\\r\\n      mortality was thus below that of the magnesium treated group in LIMIT-2.\\r\\n\\r\\n      This analysis is consistent with the results of the latest RCT recently reported by Shechter\\r\\n      and colleagues. They randomized 194 patients with acute MI considered unsuitable for\\r\\n      thrombolysis to control (N=98) or intravenous magnesium (N=96). In addition to the standard\\r\\n      contraindications to lytic therapy, reasons for exclusion from thrombolysis included either\\r\\n      presentation after six hours and/or age greater than 70 years.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Shechter et al reported 17 deaths (17.3 percent) in the placebo group and 4 deaths (4.2\\r\\n      percent) in the magnesium group corresponding to an OR of 0.21 (0.07-0.64). Consistent with\\r\\n      the hypothesis that magnesium helps reduce mortality by a direct myocardial protective effect\\r\\n      are the data on the causes of death in this latest study. In the placebo group, 11 patients\\r\\n      died from cardiogenic shock, 2 from electromechanical dissociation, 2 from myocardial rupture\\r\\n      and 1 from cardiac arrest. In contrast, in the magnesium group 1 patient died from\\r\\n      cardiogenic shock, 1 from myocardial rupture, and 2 from electromechanical dissociation.\\r\\n      Particularly noteworthy are the findings in the subset of 77 patients over the age of 70, a\\r\\n      group expected to have a high short-term mortality from acute MI. Indeed, 10 of the 44\\r\\n      elderly patients treated with placebo died (23 percent) while only 3 of the 33 elderly\\r\\n      patients treated with magnesium died (9 percent,p=0.09). Also, in this especially high risk\\r\\n      subgroup, the incidence of congestive heart failure was reduced from 25 percent in the\\r\\n      placebo patients to 18 percent in the magnesium patients.\\r\\n\\r\\n      2. Magnesium was administered late in ISIS-4. The ISIS-4 protocol required that acute phase\\r\\n      treatments for MI, including lytic therapy, were administered prior to randomization and\\r\\n      initiation of study drug therapy (i.e. magnesium). By design, therefore, magnesium could not\\r\\n      be administered in the \"early\" lytic phase (e.g. first hour). Although the time from onset of\\r\\n      symptoms to randomization was recorded in ISIS-4, time from randomization to actual\\r\\n      administration of magnesium was NOT recorded. The median time to randomization from the onset\\r\\n      of chest pain for all patients was 8 hours; in the subset of patients who did not receive\\r\\n      thrombolytic therapy (30 percent of trial patients) the median time to randomization from\\r\\n      onset of chest pain was QUITE prolonged at 12 hours.. No further details of the distribution\\r\\n      of time to randomization have been reported by the ISIS-4 investigators. In an effort to\\r\\n      answer these concerns, they conducted a retrospective survey of a 1,000 randomly selected\\r\\n      patients. This revealed that among those receiving thrombolytics only about 50 percent\\r\\n      received magnesium within the two hours following the start of thrombolytic therapy. LIMIT-2\\r\\n      randomized patients a median of 3 hours from the onset of chest pain, and in Schechter\\'s\\r\\n      study 19 of nonthrombolytic treated patients, the average time from chest pain to initiation\\r\\n      of treatment was about seven hours in both the treatment and placebo groups (a full five\\r\\n      hours earlier than in the non thrombolized group in ISIS-4) Attempts at subgroup analyses in\\r\\n      ISIS-4 also suffer from a critical lack of precise information on the actual time of\\r\\n      administration of magnesium. Thus although no apparent benefit of magnesium was seen in the\\r\\n      23,000 patients randomized within six hours of the onset of chest pain, or among the 17,000\\r\\n      who did not receive thrombolytic therapy (including 9,000 randomized within 12 hours), since\\r\\n      most of these patients received magnesium several hours after randomization, one cannot be\\r\\n      confident that reperfusion (pharmacologically induced or spontaneous) took place in the\\r\\n      presence of a raised serum magnesium level in any subgroup. Experimental attempts aimed at\\r\\n      ameliorating cellular calcium overload have shown that calcium antagonists must be\\r\\n      administered before reperfusion or during a critical window of only a few minutes following\\r\\n      reperfusion in order to minimize contractile dysfunction. Calcium flux inhibitors, such as\\r\\n      magnesium, administered too late after reperfusion appear to be ineffective.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The same observations pertain to the subset of patients alluded to by the ISIS-4\\r\\n      Investigators who were randomized within six hours of symptoms onset and had a high\\r\\n      multivariate prognosis score. In the absence of details on the timing of administration of\\r\\n      magnesium, with particular reference to the elapsed time from onset of thrombolytic therapy,\\r\\n      even in high risk subgroups, the findings of the ISIS-4 study remain compatible with the\\r\\n      hypothesis that early administration of magnesium (particularly before reperfusion occurs) is\\r\\n      associated with a reduction in mortality from acute myocardial infarction.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The implications of these observations are that, to prevent calcium overload of reperfused\\r\\n      myocytes, a loading dose of magnesium should be administered before thrombolytic therapy and\\r\\n      during the period when spontaneous reperfusion is most likely to occur in patients not\\r\\n      receiving thrombolytics. The design of ISIS-4 did not permit these conditions to be met.\\r\\n      Further, prior studies suggest that the low risk profile that characterized the ISIS-4\\r\\n      patients would have been likely to preclude obtaining much additional benefit. The results of\\r\\n      the small trial reported by Schechter et al strongly support the view that high risk MI\\r\\n      patients benefit from early treatment with magnesium infusion. However, definitive proof\\r\\n      requires the larger sample size proposed in MAGIC.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The study was a randomised, double-blind trial in 6213 patients with acute ST-elevation\\r\\n      myocardial infarction (STEMI) who were assigned a 2 g intravenous bolus of magnesium sulphate\\r\\n      administered over 15 minutes, followed by a 17 g infusion of magnesium sulphate over 24 hours\\r\\n      (n=3113), or matching placebo (n=3100). The primary endpoint was 30-day all-cause mortality.\\r\\n      At randomisation, patients were stratified by their eligibility for reperfusion therapy. The\\r\\n      first stratum included patients who were aged 65 years or older and eligible for reperfusion\\r\\n      therapy, and the second stratum included patients of any age who were not eligible for\\r\\n      reperfusion therapy. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. At 30 days, 475 (15.3%) patients in\\r\\n      the magnesium group and 472 (15.2%) in the placebo group had died.. No benefit or harm of\\r\\n      magnesium was observed in eight prespecified subgroup analyses of patients and in 15\\r\\n      additional exploratory subgroup analyses. After adjustment for factors shown to effect\\r\\n      mortality risk in a multivariate regression model, no benefit of magnesium was observed.\\r\\n    Zidovudine60 Years25 YearsAll',\n",

The study addresses\\r\\n      the problem and tests two interventions that have promise of benefit. To date, many of the\\r\\n      therapies that have been tested for congestive heart failure have either been ineffective or\\r\\n      actually decreased survival. Conventional therapy is still relatively ineffective in that\\r\\n      recent studies such as the Congestive Heart Failure - Survival Trial of Antiarrhythmic\\r\\n      Therapy (CHF-STAT) have demonstrated a mortality of 40 percent during two-and-half years of\\r\\n      follow-up. The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator appears to be effective in patients who\\r\\n      are resuscitated from cardiac arrest, but until recently, the devices required a thoracotomy\\r\\n      and had to be reserved for patients with the highest risk for sudden death. The newer\\r\\n      transvenous devices with pectoral patches can now be considered for broader applications.\\r\\n      Although there have been mixed results with amiodarone in patients with congestive heart\\r\\n      failure, there is a general consensus that it could be effective in the proper subset of\\r\\n      patients with congestive heart failure.

Donated bone marrow, which provides a source of stem and progenitor cells for bone\\r\\n      marrow reconstitution, is obtained either from related donors, usually HLA-matched siblings,\\r\\n      or from HLA-matched unrelated donors. Because of the limited availability of HLA-matched\\r\\n      related donors, HLA-matched unrelated donors are frequently the only alternative source of\\r\\n      bone marrow for transplantation. To provide matched volunteer bone marrow donors for\\r\\n      unrelated recipients, the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) was established in 1986 to\\r\\n      develop a national Registry of HLA-typed individuals who agree to donate bone marrow if\\r\\n      needed. More than 3 million potential marrow donors are now enrolled. A limitation of the\\r\\n      registry approach is the time needed to identify a donor and complete the necessary clinical\\r\\n      evaluation and laboratory testing for histocompatibility, infectious diseases, and general\\r\\n      good health. Moreover, a certain proportion of potential donors change their minds or\\r\\n      otherwise become unavailable between the time they enter the Registry and the time they are\\r\\n      called as a preliminary match for a patient. Another disadvantage is the marrow harvesting\\r\\n      procedure which requires the normal donor to be hospitalized and given general anesthesia in\\r\\n      an operating room. Finally, the NMDP Registry consists of potential donors that are primarily\\r\\n      of European Caucasian ancestry. Although great strides have been made in increasing the\\r\\n      numbers of African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian-Americans, and Native Americans, it is still\\r\\n      more difficult to find matches for these ethnic minorities than for Caucasian patients.\\r\\n\\r\\n      Human umbilical cord blood is an alternative source of hematopoietic stem and progenitor\\r\\n      cells capable of reconstituting the bone marrow of recipients with a variety of diseases.\\r\\n      Cord blood stem and progenitor cells from related donors have been successfully transplanted\\r\\n      world-wide in children with genetic or hematologic diseases. These results suggested that\\r\\n      cord blood from unrelated, HLA-matched donors also can be used for patients who need a\\r\\n      transplant but don't have a related donor. The existing problems in unrelated-donor bone\\r\\n      marrow transplantation with donor recruitment, bone marrow harvesting, and matching for\\r\\n      antigens peculiar to a particular ethnic group would be reduced if typed, tested, and frozen\\r\\n      umbilical cord blood could be made easily and rapidly available. Such a system, which could\\r\\n      complement or partially replace the present process, has been shown to be feasible. In an\\r\\n      NHLBI-sponsored program, investigators have collected and cryopreserved a bank of about 9,000\\r\\n      human UCBUs. In addition, successful searches and matches (including many 4/6 antigen\\r\\n      matches) have resulted in more than 900 unrelated-donor, UCBU transplants to date.\\r\\n      Preliminary data from both these unrelated-donor and other related-donor cord blood\\r\\n      transplants suggest that there is less GvHD than if the source of the graft were adult bone\\r\\n      marrow. The severity of GvHD also seems less even in highly mismatched recipients. One\\r\\n      important question is whether or not 3/6 HLA matched transplants in children will have\\r\\n      acceptable 180-day disease free survival. It also remains to be determined if the\\r\\n      graft-vs-leukemia effect is also less or if unrelated-donor cord blood grafts are as durable\\r\\n      as those from matched, related-donors. Most transplants conducted thus far have been in\\r\\n      children. Hence another important question is whether or not there are sufficient numbers of\\r\\n      stem cells in cord blood to support transplantation to an unrelated adult.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The initiative was proposed by the Division of Blood Diseases and Resources staff and\\r\\n      approved by the February 1995 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The Requests\\r\\n      for Proposals were released in June 1995. Contracts were awarded September 30, 1997.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The study is multicenter, with six Cord Blood Transplant Centers (CBTCs), two collecting and\\r\\n      storage centers (Cord Blood Banks -- CBBs) and one Coordinating Center. Each CBB used the\\r\\n      same protocol for recruiting donors, collecting, processing, testing, storage, retrieval from\\r\\n      storage, reprocessing from the frozen state, and shipping. Each participating CBTC used the\\r\\n      same patient selection criteria, preparative regimen for patients in the same class, initial\\r\\n      graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis, indications for the use of cytokines,\\r\\n      definitions for events and complications, and methods for evaluating immune reconstitution.\\r\\n      The main study evaluated the impact of HLA 3/6 and 4/6 matching on outcome. The primary\\r\\n      endpoint was 180-day disease free survival after UCBU transplantation. Secondary endpoints\\r\\n      included engraftment, the frequency and severity of acute and chronic GvHD with\\r\\n      stratification by degree of HLA match, overall survival, and immunologic reconstitution. Data\\r\\n      were collected on banked UCBUs to define unit quality by nucleated cell count and flow\\r\\n      cytometry of surface markers to identify effects on patient outcome.

Inability or unwillingness to participate in\\r\\n             the 12-week outpatient treatment.\\r\\n      \\n      BACKGROUND:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Mortality rates for heart failure are high, with five year survival rates approximating 30 to\\r\\n      40 percent in patients with mild to moderate symptoms and 0 to 20 percent survival in\\r\\n      patients with severe symptoms. The patient with class IV heart failure has a one year\\r\\n      survival rate of only 40 to 50 percent. This is despite advances in medical therapy and the\\r\\n      availability of ACE inhibitors. While cardiac transplantation is the most viable form of\\r\\n      treatment for these patients, it is limited by complications of chronic immunosuppression,\\r\\n      the development of graft coronary artery disease and the serious shortage of donor organs. As\\r\\n      many as 16,500 patients per year may be suitable candidates for heart transplantation. The\\r\\n      actual number of donor hearts procured over the past few years, however, has remained\\r\\n      relatively constant at 2,000. Thus, there is a strong rationale for the therapeutic\\r\\n      application of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as an alternative to cardiac\\r\\n      transplantation.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With respect to LVAD efficacy, patients have been supported for periods as long as 344 days\\r\\n      on the pneumatic system and 503 days with the electromechanical device. Experience with the\\r\\n      TCI pneumatic system in 75 LVAD patients show improved one year survival after\\r\\n      transplantation in the LVAD patients as opposed to patients who did not receive the LVAD\\r\\n      despite the same selection criteria. Experience with the vented electric LVADs in bridge\\r\\n      patients show a transplant and survival rate that is similar to the pneumatic device. LVADs\\r\\n      have also been shown to have a favorable effect on circulatory hemodynamics and exercise\\r\\n      capacity. Among 53 patients who survived the TCI LVAD procedure, 90 percent improved to New\\r\\n      York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I and 10 percent to functional class II.\\r\\n\\r\\n      With respect to safety, the principal adverse effects associated with the LVADs include\\r\\n      bleeding, hemolysis, and organ dysfunction, thromboembolism, infection, right heart failure,\\r\\n      and mechanical failure. Thromboembolic complications are low in the TCI device despite the\\r\\n      lack of systemic anticoagulation. The overall mechanical failure rate is small, less than 1\\r\\n      percent in 26 patient years of use. The vented electric and pneumatic device experience to\\r\\n      date indicates that the devices are similar with respect to adverse event rates. Thus, in\\r\\n      1997 there was a strong rationale for a randomized controlled trial that compared the\\r\\n      benefits and cost of vented electric LVADs to medical treatment. The need to perform a\\r\\n      randomized controlled study was further emphasized by the lack of rigorous data on survival,\\r\\n      quality of life, and cost effectiveness comparing LVAD support with medical therapy.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      Unblinded, randomized, multicenter. Patients were randomized to either the Thermo\\r\\n      Cardiosystems, Inc. (TCI) vented electric (VE) LVAD or optimal medical therapy (OMM) and\\r\\n      followed for at least two years. If randomized to LVAD therapy, patients received a LVAD\\r\\n      implantation within 12 hours of randomization. If randomized to medical therapy, patients\\r\\n      received optimal medical management including the use of digoxin, diuretics, and ACE\\r\\n      (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) inhibitors in maximally tolerated doses. The primary endpoint\\r\\n      was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included cardiovascular mortality, exercise\\r\\n      capacity (six-minute walk test) and health-related quality of life, adverse effects, and the\\r\\n      relative cost-effectiveness of LVADs versus medical management.

Emphysema is characterized anatomically \"by abnormal,\\r\\n      persistent enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, accompanied by\\r\\n      the destruction of the airspace walls and without obvious fibrosis\". The loss of the lung\\r\\n      architecture leads to compressible peripheral airways that close at higher than normal lung\\r\\n      volumes (early airway closure). The increased compliance and the air trapping from early\\r\\n      closure leads to hyperinflation of the lung, over distention of the chest wall, a flattened,\\r\\n      disadvantaged diaphragm, and ventilation-perfusion mismatch. In the 1950s and 1960s, Dr. Otto\\r\\n      Brantigan theorized that surgical excision of multiple wedges of lung would reduce lung\\r\\n      volumes, thereby restoring the outward elastic pull on the small airways and reduce airway\\r\\n      obstruction. Dr. Brantigan reported that the surgical excision of lung tissue resulted in\\r\\n      significant clinical improvement in some cases, but mortality was high. With little objective\\r\\n      data and high mortality, the procedure did not gain widespread acceptance.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The experience that diaphragmatic and chest wall function could be restored in emphysema with\\r\\n      lung transplantation renewed interest in Dr. Brantigan\\'s work. Improvements in surgical\\r\\n      technique have opened the possibility of performing surgical excisions of lung tissue. Recent\\r\\n      reports on LVRS have shown improvements in FEV1, FVC, TLC, RV and dyspnea and quality of life\\r\\n      assessments.\\r\\n\\r\\n      These reports generated enormous excitement among patients and their doctors. Many centers\\r\\n      around the country started performing LVRS with the result that hundreds of patients had the\\r\\n      procedure, despite the preliminary nature of the results, the lack of rigorous patient\\r\\n      selection criteria and the lack of information on long term outcome. Basic questions remain\\r\\n      such as which patient should have the surgery, what protocol should be followed, what\\r\\n      physiological tests should be obtained, and what is the long term efficacy of the technique\\r\\n      on morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. The mechanisms of benefit and the full\\r\\n      cardiopulmonary consequences are unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The concept for the trial originated in the NHLBI Workshop on Evaluation and Research in Lung\\r\\n      Volume Reduction Surgery. The initiative was reviewed and approved at the May 1996 National\\r\\n      Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council meeting. The Requests for Proposals were released in\\r\\n      June, 1996.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      In the trial, 1218 eligible patients were randomized to receive either medical therapy (610)\\r\\n      or medical therapy with LVRS(608). LVRS was performed by median sternotomy or video-assisted\\r\\n      thorascopic surgery (VATS).

The clinical\\r\\n      course can be one of abrupt and insidious exacerbations and remissions, often migratory and\\r\\n      repetitive. These events may result in impairment of function, permanently damaged organs,\\r\\n      and ultimately death. Although there is wide variability in the clinical expression of sickle\\r\\n      cell disease, this complex set of clinical manifestations is experienced by most patients. In\\r\\n      addition, there is no evidence that the primary disease process is different in children when\\r\\n      compared with adults with regard to painful episodes. However, children have a higher\\r\\n      incidence of respiratory viral infections, and are susceptible to pneumococcal septicemia.\\r\\n      With the successful completion of the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea (MSH) Trial in adults,\\r\\n      attention has now been focused on the use of this agent in children.\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) has demonstrated that sickle cell anemia\\r\\n      patients with increased painful episode rates die at a younger age. In addition, increased\\r\\n      levels of fetal hemoglobin are associated with improved survival, and is probably a reliable\\r\\n      childhood forecaster of adult life expectancy. The beneficial effect produced by hydroxyurea\\r\\n      is thought to occur because it increases fetal hemoglobin levels. Therefore, if chronic end\\r\\n      organ damage can be prevented in early childhood by hydroxyurea administration, and if the\\r\\n      crisis rate can be decreased by hydroxyurea use early in life, sickle cell anemia patients\\r\\n      may experience increased longevity and an improved quality of life.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The Phase I-Phase II study, HUG-KIDS, examined the safety of hydroxyurea. Children with\\r\\n      sickle cell anemia, age 5 to 15 years, were eligible for this multicenter Phase I/II trial.\\r\\n      Hydroxyurea was started at 15 mg/kg/d and escalated to 30 mg/kg/d unless the patient\\r\\n      experienced laboratory toxicity. Patients were monitored by 2-week visits to assess\\r\\n      compliance, toxicity, clinical adverse events, growth parameters, and laboratory efficacy\\r\\n      associated with hydroxyurea treatment.

Findings from an animal model indicate that increased intake of antioxidant vitamins\\r\\n      prevents progression of aortic fatty streaks induced by an atherogenic diet, but not from\\r\\n      more advanced injury-induced lesions. These observations suggest the hypothesis that\\r\\n      increased antioxidant vitamin intake may prevent further progression of early\\r\\n      atherosclerosis, possibly by means of reduced susceptibility of low density lipoprotein to\\r\\n      oxidative modification and consequent cytotoxic, chemotactic, chemostatic, and unregulated\\r\\n      uptake effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n      A new, automated, low-cost, portable ultrasound system for determining intima-media thickness\\r\\n      of the common carotid artery makes it feasible to test the primary prevention impact of\\r\\n      antioxidant vitamins on early atherosclerosis.

The pathogenesis of\\r\\n      unstable angina involves vasoconstriction superimposed on fixed disease, causing a temporary\\r\\n      decrease in coronary blood flow. Recent catheterization studies in patients with\\r\\n      atherosclerosis utilizing quantitative angiography and intracoronary doppler measurements of\\r\\n      blood flow velocity suggest that endothelial dysfunction results in a paradoxical coronary\\r\\n      vasoconstriction response to certain neurohumoral stimuli including acetylcholine,\\r\\n      catecholamines, and serotonin with resultant myocardial ischemia. Therapeutic agents which\\r\\n      prevent or limit this vasoconstriction may prevent recurrent ischemia and/or myocardial\\r\\n      infarction in unstable angina patients. Recently, estrogen receptors were identified in the\\r\\n      smooth muscle of post-mortem human coronary arteries. Work in animal models and studies in\\r\\n      post-menopausal women suggest that intravenous estrogen acutely decreases coronary vascular\\r\\n      resistance, increases coronary blood flow, and prevents the paradoxical response to\\r\\n      acetylcholine in patients with endothelial dysfunction.\\r\\n\\r\\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\\r\\n\\r\\n      The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial tested the hypothesis\\r\\n      that intravenous estrogen followed by oral estrogen and the combination of intravenous and\\r\\n      oral estrogen and progesterone in the routine management of unstable angina were beneficial\\r\\n      compared with placebo in post-menopausal women.

dependency within the past months use of any psychotropic drugs including maois in the past months background the pediatric medical community has long been concerned about the increased incidence of cerebral dysfunction among newborns with severe cyanotic congenital heart disease there has been concern about a great number of potential predisposing factors including the effects of hypoxemia and acidosis trauma during cardiac catheterization and the duration of prolonged decreased arterial oxygen saturation many infants undoubtedly undergo significant brain damage prior to surgery but may be subject to further insult in the peri operative period the proposed trial studied circulatory arrest versus low flow bypass methods of surgical support in a homogeneous group of patients who were managed in identical fashion in all other aspects of their treatment major factors such as the influence of cardiac catheterization and presurgical status were specifically incorporated into the primary statistical analysis this was important in order to identify significant predisposing causes of brain injury beyond the surgical techniques being compared and to increase the power of the comparison design narrative randomized partially blinded infants were assigned to deep hypothermia and either circulatory arrest or low flow bypass support during arterial switch surgical repair of transposition of the great arteries randomization was stratified by diagnosis with or without septal defect and by specific surgeon of three thus yielding six strata within each treatment group randomization was also blocked to minimize imbalances in treatment assignment between strata the study was partially blinded in that outcome data were obtained by investigators who were unaware of management surgical care and intensive care were standardized hemodynamic assessment was made early in the post operative period the outcomes of primary interest magnetic resonance imaging neurologic examination and psychometric testing were reviewed at the one year evaluation to maximize relevance to the long term prognosis pre operative and seven to ten day post operative neurologic examination was also carried out developmental status at one year was measured by the bayley developmental scales and the fagan test of infant intelligence brain function was assessed by neurologic examination at one year the recruitment period extended from april to february the trial was extended through december to allow four years of follow up the follow up allowed the assessment of a primary outcome variable in the neurologic domain and a primary outcome variable in the developmental domain the primary outcome variable of the neurologic examination resulted in an ordered classification of three categories of normal minor and major dysfunction such as apraxia or cerebral palsy development was assessed using standardized measures of cognition behavior language attention and motor skills the primary outome variable for the developmental evaluation was the intelligence quotient on the wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence wppsi r secondary outcome variables included measurements of behavior and performance in specific domains of speech and language visual motor integration attention motor function and temperament beginning in january the study was extended for an additional four years through december to compare the effects of the two intraoperative methods with respect to developmental and neurologic status at eight years of age developmental status was assessed by the wechsler individual achievement test primary outcome and by the presence of learning disabilities and performance in specific neuropsychologic domains secondary outcomes neurologic status was determined by neurologic exam primary outcome and by specific types of dysfunction such as motor problems the study also compared the academic and intellectual performance of the cohort at

low flow bypass perfusion on neurologic functioning in infants undergoing heart surgery men and women ages to with angiographically documented one two or three vessel coronary disease no myocardial infarction during the preceeding six weeks and not receiving streptokinase alteplase or lipid lowering drugs background cooley s anemia beta thalassemia major hereafter referred to as thalassemia is a severe inherited blood disorder characterized by a quantitative defect in the synthesis of the beta chain of hemoglobin caused by any of more than known mutations in and around the beta globin gene cluster the disease is characterized by severe anemia beginning in the first to months of life if untreated the life expectancy is less than years of age chronic red blood cell transfusions to maintain hemoglobin levels between and gm dl hypertransfusion alleviate the anemia and partially suppress erythropoiesis the regular administration of red blood cells also improves growth delays or prevents enlargement of the liver and spleen and prevents the development of bone abnormalities that cause fractures as well as disfiguring changes known as cooley s facies transfusions carry risks of alloimmunization iron overload and blood transmitted infections in the absence of effective iron chelation therapy iron overload leads to numerous complications including delayed or absent sexual development diabetes mellitus cirrhosis cardiac arrhythmias and congestive heart failure nonchelated or poorly chelated patients usually die of heart disease by to years of age the addition of chelation therapy with deferoxamine dfo to the treatment of cooley s anemia has dramatically improved the outcome for affected patients with regular chelation therapy the accumulation of excessive iron can be prevented studies have demonstrated that well chelated patients have normal or only modest increases in liver iron improved growth sexual development and most importantly a markedly reduced chance of developing iron induced heart disease in the past few years several new approaches to the treatment of thalassemia have included marrow or stem cell transplantation the use of young red blood cells neocytes for transfusion maintenance of a higher pretransfusion hemoglobin level new iron chelators and the use of drugs such as hydroxyurea erythropoietin and butyrate compounds it is recognized that even with a clinical network the number of patients with cooley s anemia who can be enrolled in a research protocol is likely to be small therefore although a randomized clinical trial may be the preferred way of assessing the clinical benefits of a new therapy it may not be feasible in some instances even using biomarkers or other surrogate outcome measures depending upon the specific questions being addressed other study designs might be appropriate these might include pre and post treatment assessment or historical control studies in all cases the proposed design including sample size would be evaluated by the protocol review committee there is an urgent need to evaluate new and existing therapeutic approaches for persons with thalassemia and to disseminate the findings to health care professionals patients and the public there are several reasons why a thalassemia clinical research network will accelerate clinical research and meet this need the highly variable and sometimes complicated clinical manifestations of thalassemia often make it difficult to accumulate a large number of comparable patients in one center furthermore uniformity in treatment protocols may reduce the number of patients needed at each clinical center also the tcrn mechanism will help pool the necessary clinical expertise and administrative resources to facilitate the conduct of multiple and novel therapeutic trials in a timely efficient manner this in turn would promote rapid dissemination of research findings to health care professionals design narrative the network was originally funded in and has been extended through june to perform interventional clinical trials in key areas of thalassemia care two major trials are proposed first a randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of dfo alone versus dfo plus deferiprone on cardiac disease due to transfusional iron overload second a randomized trial of arginine versus sildenafil for pulmonary hypertension an important problem in thalassemia intermedia and other hemolytic states goals are to provide an infrastructure for development launch and prompt completion of small innovative trials in thalassemia and to improve assessment of phenotype and clinical outcomes in thalassemia to facilitate current and future clinical trials this will be accomplished by two studies the thalassemia longitudinal cohort tlc study and the iron burden study which is a detailed study of iron related organ damage comparing measures of iron burden in the heart liver and pancreas to outcomes of iron related organ dysfunction combined with the clinical trials and the ability to perform detailed genotype phenotype correlations these improved phenotype and outcome measures are powerful tools
